I. > > > > Feature List:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          
  1) Multiple Follower support
       
     Allows dogmeat + 5 additional followers. 
       
  2) Appearance Sculpting
       
     Change the appearance of human and Ghoul followers using the same 
     sculpting system used to create the player. 
       
     Includes additional custom appearance editing tools that let you  
     scale followers size, change race, eyes or add gender agnostic hair. 
       
  3) Commentary Controls
       
     Manage commentary. Filter out negative/positive comments and prevent 
     followers from all blurting out their comments at once. 

     Includes support for multiple interjections. During Main Quest 
     dialogs where companions can interject with their opinion, AFT
     allows all followers to say their piece before resuming the 
     conversation. 
       
  4) Personality reshaping
       
     Disable or even flip follower likes and dislikes.
       
  5) Follower Outfits
       
     Create up to 4 outfits: A standard outfit, a combat outfit, a 
     city outfit, and a camp outfit. They will automatically change as needed. 
       
  6) Gear Management
       
     Tell followers to remove all your junk, then have them convert all that 
     junk to scrap or caps. Then with a single command tell them to give you 
     everything they aren't using. (Transfers everything not assigned to an 
     outfit). 
       
  7) Follower Locater
       
     Includes "Locate Follower" function to select any NPC that AFT manages
     and have AFT guide you to them with a quest objective locater. 
       
  8) Pose Followers
         
     POSE non-active followers in an assortment of animations from dancing to 
     praying to add ambiance camp or settlement.
         
  9) Camp Support
         
     Includes mobile camp that can act as traveling home-base. An excellent 
     feature for people who like to avoid fast travel and embrace a more 
     immersive play style. AFT Camp includes script-backed furniture that 
     goes beyond the capabilities of normal settlements. For example, a 
     memory lounger that will take you back to the pre-war world. 

     Includes option to Sync up your Camp workbenches with any locally 
     detected settlement. 
         
  10) AI Tweaks
       
     Assign Combat Styles such as Ninja, Boomstick and Sniper or 
     use AFT's advanced AI management to Dynamically change archetype
     based on follower load-out and distance to their enemies. 
  
     And it doesn't end there. Toggling Power Armor helmets on and off
     for combat, ignore traps, set preferred follower distance and 
     caution levels. Maybe you want your followers to stay out of the
     fight so you can do all the fighting. Or have Danse scout ahead
     of the player like dogmeat to draw enemy fire.
      
      Followers with Stimpaks and Repair kits will also heal each other
      and help each other out. You can create a "medic" type Follower
      by simply loading them up with stimpaks.
         
  11) NPC Info
         
      View detailed information about your followers including attributes,  
      traits, perks, factions, race, home as well as personality traits
      (reactions) and relationship info for those NPCs that support it. 
         
      NOTE : This feature can also be used from the IMPORT menu on any
             non-hostile NPC for pre-import evaluation.
         
      By Default, Info reveals synths. This can be disabled if you desire.
         
  12) Tweak Settings (all are optional)
         
      - Customize S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats and gain new stats to distribute
        as followers level up. 

      - Unlimited Ammo - Turn off Follower ammo depletion

      - Sync Weapon Draw

      - Follower Mortality : Optionally make followers mortal.

      - Catch-up on Weapon draw : Have followers teleport to your side anytime
        you draw your weapon.

      - Synch PowerArmor Usage : Followers can be configured to enter/exit
        powerarmor with player.

      - No PA Damage   - Turn off Follower Power Armor damage

      - Home Assignment : Tell a follower to hang out at AFT Camp, go to a
        Settlement or go back to their original home. You can also tell them
        To make your current location their home.
         
      - Track Kills    - Optional Kill count tracker

      - Pack Mule : A convenience setting to increase Follower base carry 
        capacity to 2000.
         
      - Ignore Friendly Fire : In Fallout 4, by default Companions ignore
        friendly fire. This setting allows you to turn that off if you 
        wish for more realistic responses to being shot.
          
      - No Collision : Instead of having to wait for followers to back up
        and get out of your way, just walk through them.             
         
  13) Clear Settlement
            
      The worst thing about starting a new game is getting to a settlement and
      realizing you need to spend 20 minutes re-scrapping everything. Now you
      can just tell your followers to do it for you with a single command and 
      be done in seconds.
         
  14) Followers Build Prefab Settlements
         
      For a price, you can also tell your follower to build the settlement for 
      you. Prefabs include options for building a parameter fence only and 
      options to build the entire settlement. Sanctuary is Free. The others 
      will cost you.
               
  15) Additional Outfits for Nick
         
      With all the Gen2 body parts laying about, ever wonder why Nick doesn't 
      just grab some space parts and fix himself up? AFT adds some Nick-
      compatible outfits in case you want to change his look and fix his 
      hand in the process. 
         
  16) Save your Spouse
         
      Your spouse was shot in the head, but then immediately frozen. If you
      visit your spouse with Curie before the power in Vault 111 runs out (at
      the end of Act I hint, hint), you can save them.
         
      See below for more details on what to expect. 
         
  17) Settlement Export/Import: (PC Only)
         
      Export a settlement snapshot as a batch file and share it with others or 
      transfer to another game locally. (Requires console access to load). 

      You can also export a settlement snapshot to papyrus in order to quickly 
      build an AFT Prefab ADDON. (See section X below). The later route is more 
      work,  but offers a way to get your settlement onto XBOX.
      

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. > > > >  DLC Compatibility
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  AFT Includes DLC companion support.

  A. Automatron : 

     While technically the DLC lets you install the M-SAT on any Robot, only
     install it on Ada.

  B. Nuka World : 

     All companions will work fine in Nuka World however the DLC only provides
     additional commentary for Porter Gage. Advise including him in your 
     load-out while in Nuka world (once available). 

  C. Far Harbor

     All companions will work fine in Far Harbor however the DLC only provides
     additional commentary for Nick Valentine and Old Longfellow. Advise
     including at least one of those companions in your load-out while in Far
     Harbor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. > > > >  Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
  A. Requirements
        
     This mod was compiled against Fallout 4 patch 1.10.120.0.1  To minimize 
     the possibility of bugs, it is advised that users have the same patch or
     newer. The mod may work with older versions of the game, but may be 
     be less stable. To see what version you have, hit ESC within the game 
     and look in the bottom left corner of the System:Save/Load screen.
        
     This Mod does NOT require any DLC. 
        
  B. Manual (Downloaded from NexusMods)
          
     This is probably the safest method as it ensures full control over when 
     you upgrade (or don't upgrade) to the latest version of the mod. Users
     wishing to make use of the Settlement Export capability should be sure
     to get the version with that capability enabled (All versions available
     at NexusMods, but not versions downloaded from Bethesda).
         
     1) If you do not already have it, get 7-zip : www.7-zip.org
         
        ** Do not use WinRar to open/extract .7z files. It can corrupt them.
         
     2) Once 7-zip is installed, open the .7z file downloaded from NexusMods 
        Typically you need only double click the file:
         
          AmazingFollowerTweaksFO4_v1_23.7z
         
     3) Within the 7-zip window, select the menu options: 
         
          "Help" -> "About 7-zip"
          
        Ensure you have version 9.20 or greater/newer. If you do not, return to
        step 1 and get the latest version. 
          
     4) The 7-zip window will show 3 files:
           
          /Data
          readme_aft_1_23.txt
          unlockcurie.txt
          
        Make sure ALL items are hi-lighted. To hi-light all entries quickly, 
        hit CTRL + A
         
     5) Hit Extract and then [...] to browse to the location of your fallout4
        installation. 
         
        Most people will find it in one of these two locations:
         
          Computer -> C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4
            
            or
            
          Computer -> C:\Program Files\steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4
            
        After you click on and hi-light "Fallout 4", click [OK] and then [OK]
        once more
            
     6) If you previously had AFT installed, you will be prompted to confirm 
        file overwrite for four files: 
            
        /Data/AmazingFollowerTweaks - Main.bsa
        /Data/AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp
        /Data/unlockcurie.txt
		/unlockcurie.txt
            
        Click [Yes] to each file as it comes up
        
        If you did not have AFT previously, skip this step.
         
     7) When you start up Fallout 4, go to Mods (Hit Home to skip the login) 
        and make sure AmazingFollowerTweaks mod is checked. Move the mod to 
        the BOTTOM of your load order.
            
     8) For what to expect after starting a new game or loading a save game, 
        see Usage below. 
            
  C. Installing from Bethesda.net

     As far as I know, Bethesda.net does not offer download options. Instead 
     you open the game and browse Mods from within the game.

     Simply type "Amazing Follower Tweaks" in the mod search box and 
     install from there. Make sure you place it at the bottom of your load
     order. Bethesda.net does not come with the unlockcurie support 
     support script. 
                  
  D. Upgrading
             
     When upgrading AFT, you simply update the mod files. If you are using
     Nexus, just clobber the existing files with the new files.
             
  E. Notes

     This mod makes heavy use of scripts. Should you decide to uninstall the
     mod, do not simply deactivate the mod. Follow the uninstall directions
     below in section VII. 

     *** IF USING AN ALTERNATE START MOD ***

     My advice to anyone using an alt start mod is to wait and not enable 
     AFT until after you:

     1) Have a pipboy
     2) Have Completed the Main Quest "Out of Time" (Rescue the minute men in 
        Concord)

     That will allow AFT to initialize immediately and hopefully prevent any 
     initialization bugs an alt-start mod may introduce. 
               
  F. Known Issues

     - Loading a Prefab and/or Clearing a Settlement can crash your game if done 
       from a settlement where you have children actively harvesting plants or 
       sleeping in beds. Use caution when the settlement has children. 
       (Warwick Homestead, Nordagen Beach, Somverville Place)
          
     - Do not assign ring to managed follower outfits. The ring slot is used to 
       bump the AI and can fail if an outfit includes a ring. (leaving them 
       naked or wearing the wrong clothes)

     - The sculpt command is fragile. It lets you do something the game never
       intended to let users do. So here are some pointers to avoid issues:

       -- Only use from a safe location where you wont get attacked. 

       -- Make sure you are standing up when you use it. 

       -- It is best to holster your weapon before you activate. 

       -- After activating Sculpt from Pipboy, position yourself
          and activate it a second time from dialog.

       -- Once the dialog activation is started, don't move and 
          be patient.

       -- Once you are finished sculpting, wait until the sculpt 
          finalizes (normally 3 to 10 seconds). Don't fast travel
          or do anything that would cause a loading screen for at
          least 10 seconds.

       -- In the case of Curie:

          --- Some of the longer hair styles may have issues with 
              Curie.

          --- On PC, you need to travel to another Worldspace to 
              cause her model to reload and the changes to take
              effect. Typically you must fast travel into/outof
              Diamond City. Sometimes telling her to enter/exit
                 PA will also reload her model.

          --- On XBOX, Curie will become invisible after the edits. 
              You need to save your game, then shutdown Fallout 4
              and reload for the edits to take effect.  This will
              also work on PC (but is more work). 

       -- If you change Codsworth to human, he will have blood around
          his neck. You must change his face with sculpt (even if you 
          just change it back) for the blood stains to go away. 

       -- Nick is not compatible with the human race. However AFT allows
          you to make him human so that you can activate sculpt on 
          his floating head and change his hair color. (Sculpt is
          incompatible with the Gen2 Synth Race). After changing his
          hair color, you should change his race back to Gen2 
          If you later assigned hair to nick using the PARTS menu, 
          the hair will maintain the color assigned when using the 
          sculpt command.
  
              
  G. Trouble Shooting
          
     First Steps: 
     
     1) Ensure AFT is at the Bottom of your Load Order
	 
     2) Ensure the file <installdir>/Data/Scripts/followersscript.pex 
        does not exist. install directory for most user is:
     
        C:\Program Files\steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4
		
     3) Visit the mods home page at nexusmods and check the forum that 
        tracks known incompatible mods. Make sure you are not using one 
        of the mods listed.
		
     4) TGM (God Mode) stops player combat events. When activated mid-combat, 
        it makes the game think the player is forever in combat, which can 
        break things like outfits, auto-relax and even idle chatter. For those
        who use TGM, go to 3rd person view, open console, click on the player
        and use the command "IsInCombat". If it says the player is in combat
        when they are not, you need to disable TGM and get into a fight to 
        fix the state.
     
     Second Steps:
     
     If the above steps do not fix the issue, then confirm the following:
          
     1) Does your version of Fallout 4 match the version AFT was 
        compiled against? 
          
        You can get the version of Fallout 4 from the bottom left corner 
        of the Settings screen (You have to load a save game first)
          
          AFT Version 1.05      : FO4 Patch 1.10.26  
          AFT Version 1.06-1.14 : FO4 Patch 1.10.40
          AFT Version 1.15-1.16 : FO4 Patch 1.10.64
          AFT Version 1.17-1.19 : FO4 Patch 1.10.89
          AFT Version 1.20-1.22 : FO4 Patch 1.10.114
          AFT Version 1.23+     : FO4 Patch 1.10.120.0.1
            
     2) Did you clean your Cache?
           
        Steam -> Library -> (All Games) Fallout 4 -> Properties 
        -> Local Files -> Verify Integrity of Game Cache
        
     3) AFT Master Controller not appearing
                  
        If you are starting a new game, the AFT items will not appear in your  
        inventory until you emerge from Vault 111 (AFT delays initialization 
        until the quest Out of Time begins). 
     
        Some Alt-Start mods do not start the quest Out of Time, which can 
        cause AFT to not initialize properly. If you use an ALT START mod, you 
        should leave AFT disabled until you do something within your play-through
        to start/finished the quest Out of Time (such as talking to Codsworth and
        then rescuing the MinuteMen in Concord.)
     
        #4 below can also cause the AFT Master Control to now show up. 
               
     4) Were you using another multi-follower mod before AFT?
        
        Follower mods all tend to change the same core game resources. So if 
        you are loading a save game that previously was exposed to a different 
        Follower Mod, you may encounter issues that appear to be related to AFT 
        but are in fact due to a lingering mod conflict. It is possible for 
        mods to hold onto resources even after they are uninstalled. 

        To fix these issues, you have to revert to a save that only had the 
        previous Follower Mod. (You may have to disable AFT/Re-enable the 
        previous Follower mod). Follow the previous mods uninstall instructions 
        (Similar to the instructions this mod provides). If you used a Follower 
        mod that has no uninstall instructions, your only option may be 
        starting a new game or reverting back to a save from before installing
        the other follower mod.

     Mod Conflict Diagnosis:
     -----------------------
     Issue these two console commands. If either method reports an error, then 
     there is a mod conflict (possibly baked into your save game).

        cqf Followers GetStandardLoiterCoolDownTime
        cqf Followers GetInfatuatedFollowers

     Users can attempt to force initialize AFT with the following command:
     Some users have reported this command can correct a rare issue where
     the prefabs do not properly initialize.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. > > > >  Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           
  New Game:
           
    If you start a new game, your first sign that AFT is installed will be some
    new commentary regarding your spouse in (future) Vault 111. Specifically, 
    if you take your spouses wedding ring, the player will mention that they 
    are not a doctor but that they will return (implying they realize the 
    spouse could be saved).
           
    Upon exiting Vault 111, AFT will initialize, a thank you will appear and 
    you will find 2 new items in your inventory:  The AFT Readme, the 
    AFT Activator and the AFT Settings holotape. The AFT Activator will 
    automatically be assigned to Quick Slot 3.
	
    ** Sometimes the police baton will override the AFT favorite assignment.
       If this happens, you will need to manually assign the favorite by
       hi-lighting the AFT Activator and hit the Fav key (Normally Q).

  Loading an Existing Save Game:
           
    If you load a save game where you have already exited Vault 111, AFT will 
    immediately begin initializing. During initialization, a progress bar will
    appear as a flashing notification in the upper left corner. Once 
    initialization is complete, a thank you message will appear and you will 
    find 2 new items in your inventory:  The AFT Activator and the AFT Settings
    holotape. You will also find that the AFT Activator has already been 
    assigned to Quick Slot 3.

  Managing Followers with AFT:

    You don't have to do anything special to manage one of the games original
    companions with AFT. Just talk to them and ask them to follow you when the
    time comes.
     
    AFT also allows you to import NPCs who were not originally companion
    options. To do this, you use a special item called the AFT Activator
    on an NPC and select how you wish to import them. More on that below.
    
  Terminology : 
           
    Managed Follower : Any NPC that is being managed by AFT. AFT can manage up 
                       to 32 NPCs. For example, AFT can be used to LOCATE 
                       anyone it manages. 

    Active Follower  : An NPC that actively follows the player around in the
                       game. AFT supports up to 5 active followers. 6 if you
                       include Dogmeat. 
           

  A. AFT Activator : Overview
           
     The AFT Activator is a small device that appears in your inventory in the
     AID category. It is a usable inventory item, so it can be assigned to a 
     quick slot. The AFT Activator is auto-assigned to slot 3 during 
     initialization. You can choose to assign it elsewhere if you wish (or 
     not assign it at all). 
           
     When used, the activator will raise your PipBoy and you will see one of
     three menus appear depending on what was under the cross-hair when the
     activator was activated.
           
     If the cross-hair is on a Managed NPC, you will see all AFT commands and 
     options with the followers name at the top of the screen. 
           
        ----------------------
        [FOLLOWER NAME]:
        ----------------------
        > Actions
        > Gear
        > Combat AI
        > Info

        ----------------------
        > Select ALL Followers
        > Cancel
        ----------------------
           
     If the cross-hair is on an unmanaged but eligible NPC, you will see import
     options and an option to scan the NPC for more information.
           
        ----------------------
        IMPORT:
        ----------------------
        > Scan NPC
        > Make Follower (Full Import)
        > Make Follower (Leave AI intact)
        > Make Follower (Follow only. DO NOT MANAGE)
        > Make Settler
        > Ignored NPC
        > Cancel
        ----------------------
                  
     If the cross-hair had no target, you will see a list of commands that 
     affect ALL Active Followers (Equivalent to selecting everyone). Not all 
     menu options will appear in this mode of operation. 
           
        ----------------------
        ALL FOLLOWER MODE:
        ----------------------
        > Actions
        > Gear
        > Tools                             
        ----------------------
        > Select Follower
        > Cancel
        ----------------------
           
     NOTES: 

       - The activator will not work on NPCs who are in combat. 
           
       - Using the activator on an Active Follower will randomly result in 
         Follower commentary. Selecting Additional commands may result in even
         more commentary. This provides immersion but also introduces delays. 
         Users who prefer a more responsive interface can disable follower 
         commentary associated with the activator from the followers chat 
         settings
           
       - Should you lose the activator, you can use the Aft Settings Holotape
         to spawn another one. 
     
  B. AFT Activator : Follower Mode
      
     We start follower mod by placing the cross hair on someone who is already
     following us (and activate the AFT Activator. The following Menu will 
     appear:
      
         ----------------------

         ----------------------
      
     1) Actions
           
        A list of commands you can issue to the Follower(s). Many of these 
        commands mirror the options you see when you talk to Companions.
           
              --------------------------
              Actions                   
              --------------------------
              Gather Loose Items        
              Get Behind Me             
              Command Mode
              Wait Here                 
              Hangout Here              
              Come with Me

              Fetch my Power Armor      
              Setup Camp                
              Teardown Camp
              Dismiss                    
              --------------------------
             
        DETAILS:
                          
        a) Gather Loose Items
             
           The Follower searches around the player (Radius = 1.5X the size of 
           AFT CAMP) and gather up any items they see. In Follower Mode, the
           Follower you order to Gather Items receives the items. 

           Progress messages will be shown (normally less than 5 seconds)
           with a summary of discovered items as well as items ignored because
           they were owned or containers that were locked. 

           NOTE : Gather Loose Items is a time saving convenience method
                  and ignores followers carry weight limits. If you are
                  opposed to followers carrying more than their limit 
                  allows, then don't use this method. 
                      
        b) Get Behind Me
             
           Causes the follower you are speaking with to teleport behind you.
           while no clip support may allow you to pass through them, they
           may still choose to stand somewhere that is in the way. For example,
           if you need to pick a lock or hit a button they are standing in front
           of.
        
        c) Command Mode
          
             The follower will enter command mode. Usefull for imported NPCs
             that may not normally support command mode. Also supports remote
             access. If used from ALL FOLLOWER MODE or as a hotkey, this
             command places the previously commanded actor back into command
             mode. Activating a second time toggles command mode off.
             
        d) Wait Here 
              
             Appears if the follower is an Active Follower currently in Follow
             mode. Selecting will cause follower to enter Wait mode. 

        e) Hangout Here 
              
             Appears if the follower is an Active Follower currently in Follow
             mode. Selecting will cause follower to enter Wait mode and Sandbox.

             Hangout Mode is also more persistant that Wait mode. If the player
             fast travels or causes a loading screen, the follower will not catch 
             up until summoned using Summon All Followers. 

        f) Come with Me
              
             Appears on followers you dismissed. That is, they are managed, but 
             not active. Causes the previously dismissed Follower to begin
             following you once again.
			 
             For many imported followers, this is the only way to make them follow
             you once dismissed.
                
             If you are at the maximum active follower limit, another follower
             will automatically be dismissed. 

        g) Follow Me
                
             Appears if an Active follower is in WAIT or HANGOUT Mode. Causes 
             them to begin following you again.
           
        h) Enter Power Armor
           
            Appears if Follower is not wearing Power Armor but has one assigned.
            Causes the NPC to enter their PA. They will run up to it if it is 
            nearby or the PA will be teleported to them if it is not.
            
           POWER ARMOR ASSIGNEMENT:
           
               To assign a PowerArmor to a follower simply have them enter a
               power armor. Assignment occurs when they enter. 

               For those unfamiliar with the process, Start Command-Mode by 
               "grabbing" the follower from a distance. On PC, you use the [e]
               key by default. This will cause the target hair to show context
               sensitive information based on what the target hair is hovering 
               over. Hover over a PowerArmor and tell the Follower to Enter. 
             
               This assigns the PowerArmor to the Follower. It will remain  
               assigned until another NPC or the player enters the PowerArmor. 
             
               The easiest way to un-assign PowerArmor is to have the player
               enter a followers PA.
               
        i) Exit Power Armor
               
            Appears if NPC is wearing PowerArmor. Causes them to exit.
                  
        j) Fetch My PowerArmor
           
            Causes the players PowerArmor to teleport to the follower, as if the
            follower fetched it.
                                   
        k) Setup Camp

            Appears if Camp is not already setup. The command scans the 
            terrain around you and builds camp based on characteristics.
            Construction can take up to a minute depending on what you have 
            enabled and purchased.
           
        l) Teardown Camp 
           
            Appears if Camp is currently setup. If you issue the command in 
            the vicinity of camp, camp will immediately begin to fade. Teardown
            can take up to two minutes depending on the complexity of your camp
            and what you have purchased/enabled.
           
            If you issue Teardown when you are away from camp, a 24 hour delay
            penalty is added. (1 game day). This is to simulate the amount of 
            time it would take your follower to return to camp, tear it down
            and return to you.  Activating Teardown a second time while the 
            penalty window is active will tell you how much time is left 
            before camp is available. You can cancel the penalty by returning
            to camp and issuing the command from camp itself. 
           
           NOTES : 
           
             Special things happen the first time you setup camp. See the Aft 
             Camp section below for more details. 
                      
        m) Dismiss
           
            Appears on Active Followers and will cause them to stop following
            the player and return to their assigned Home. Since AFT has a
            dedicated home assignment menu, dismissed followers will not 
            prompt you for a home location.
           
     2) Gear
           
        Use this menu to configure outfits or issue commands for bulk inventory

                 ----------------------
           
           Standard Outfit:
                 
             The default outfit that gets used when no other conditions apply.
             If you only setup 1 outfit, this is the one to setup.
                 
           Combat Outfit:
                 
             Equipped when combat begins. Unequipped when combat ends if the 
             environment matches another configured outfit (standard). Setting a 
             Combat+Standard outfit is an easy way to cause auto-toggling of 
             gear that you only want during combat. Whether it is simply a 
             helmet toggle or a full wardrobe change.

             NOTE: If you setup a combat outfit, AFT will force the follower
             to use that weapon assigned to the outfit. If you do not
             want this behavior, skip the combat outfit and only create 
             a standard outfit.
                 
           City Outfit:
                 
             Equipped when entering settlements and cities. When leaving a 
             settlement/city, the Outfit will be removed if the environment 
             matches another configured outfit.
                 
           Camp Outfit:
                 
             Equipped when approaching AFT Camp.  When leaving camp, the Outfit
             will be removed if the environment matches another configured 
             outfit.
             
           Home Outfit:
             
             Equipped when within the Location or Anchor that marks the 
             Followers HOME (set via Settings -> Set Home). This outfit 
             will trump all but combat outfits. So if you setup camp
             within a settlement and set Home to be AFT Camp, you will 
             use the Home outfit over the Settlement or Camp outfits. 
             
           Swim Outfit:
             
             Equipped when the player is swimming. You must be swimming for 
             a minimum of 3 seconds before the outfit(s) will activate. Once 
             swimming, you must be on dry land for at least 5 seconds before 
             the outfit(s) will deactivate.
                       
           [ ] SET/Use [TYPE] OUTFIT:
                 
             When you "Set" an outfit, the trade menu will open allowing you to
             make adjustments. When the trade menu closes, AFT takes a snapshot
             of what the follower is wearing, assigning it to the outfit. 
                 
             Toggling an outfit OFF will disable/clear the outfit but will also
             equip the outfit in the process. Users can use a quick toggle 
             Off/On to make updates or just get a glimpse of what is assigned. 
          
           Force Combat Outfit Weapon:
             
             Toggle indicates if AFT should force the follower to use the weapon 
             assigned to the combat outfit when combat begins. When toggled, the 
             combat outfit weapon is equipped with flags indicating the game should
             not allow the NPC to unequip it. When not toggled, the weapon is
             still equipped, but the follower is free to switch weapon mid-combat.

            (unceck this box and don't assign a weapon to the combat outfit if you 
             want the AI to handle weapon selection at all times)               
             
           CLEAR ALL OUTFITS:
                 
             Unsets all outfits assigned to the selected NPC (SELECTED 
             MODE) or all Active Followers (ALL FOLLOWERS MODE). Unlike 
             other toggles, this will not restore any outfits. Followers
             will keep wearing what they have on and simply stop reacting
             to outfit change events.
             
           UnManage Outfits

             The presence of this command indicates AFT is managing your 
             followers outfit. 

             When AFT is managing your followers outfits, not only does it
             change outfits in different environments, but it also removes
             the followers default weapon from the outfit. This gives you 
             more control over what weapon your follower uses in combat.

             Selecting "Unmanage Outfits" will Clear All Outfits (if any 
             are set), attempt to restore their original outfit and 
             re-enable the default weapon. 

        c) Dedupe
                 
           The purpose is to safely offload excess gear onto a follower
           when you get weighted down. The command scans the players 
           inventory for a list of common items and removes duplicates,
           transferring them to the follower. It also removes ALL Junk.

           The idea is that unique and quest items are unlikely to be 
           found in pairs. So removing duplicates and junk is probably
           safe and shouldn't break quests or inadvertently remove 
           something you want to keep.    
                 
           The scan list excludes a number of items such as Fusion Cores, 
           Stimpaks, lock picks, ammo and other rare or valuable stackables. 
                 
           This command ignores the follower's Carry Limits.
                 
        d) Dejunk
                 
           Transfers all items considered "Junk" from the players inventory to
           the followers inventory. Junk is anything that can be broken
           down into more basic raw materials. 
           
           This command ignores the follower's Carry Limits making it easy to 
           bring large amounts of junk with you to support settlement 
           renovations.                 
                 
        e) Sell Unused/All Gear

           This command will convert a followers inventory into caps. The 
           only items that will remain are those assigned to an outfit. If no 
           outfits are assigned, it will appear as Sell ALL Gear.
             
           Background : The idea behind the command is that you are basically
           sending your  follower on an errand to sell their gear where ever 
           they can at a reduced price. As a result, You wont get as many
           caps, but you also don't have to spend hours/days running around 
           the commonwealth looking for buyers (With caps to spend). 
             
           When issued from ALL FOLLOWERS MODE, you will first receive a 
           confirmation prompt. 

        f) Unequip All
                 
           The command is pretty self explanatory. A few notes: 
                 
           - If the follower is in PowerArmor, they will exit the PowerArmor, 
             unequip all and then Re-enter the PowerArmor to avoid PowerArmor
             related glitches.
                 
           - Following the command, only PLAYABLE items will be visible in 
             the followers inventory. If the follower was wearing unplayable
             items, you may not be able to re-equip them. AFT includes fixes
             for some NPCs such as Nick Valentine. Other NPCs such as Deacon
             may need new clothes (and a wig). Saving is recommended before 
             using the command.
                 
        G) More    
                 
           Various commands to help manage inventory and junk in bulk:
                 
                 ----------------------
                 More
                 ----------------------
                 Convert Junk to Scrap
                 Give me your junk
                 Give me your scrap
                 Give me unused Gear
                 ----------------------
             
           CONVERT JUNK TO SCRAP:
             
             This command instructs a follower to convert all the junk in their
             possession into scrap. You might do this to lighten the load or 
             just to keep tabs on how much of each type of scrap you have 
             collected. 
             
             Since followers can have massive accumulations of junk, a progress
             bar is provided while the operation is underway.
             
           GIVE ME YOUR JUNK:
             
             Transfers all the JUNK to the player (this includes scrap). 
             
           GIVE ME YOUR SCRAP
             
             Transfers only raw scrap to the player. Does NOT transfer 
             non-scrapped Junk.
                          
           GIVE ME UNUSED GEAR
             
             Transfers any items that are not assigned to a follower outfit to 
             the player. 
             
        NOTES:
          
          - If an outfit has a weapon, the ammo that the weapon uses is also 
            considered part of the outfit even if the ammo wasn't equipped 
            when the outfit was created.
             
          - If you setup any outfit for Nick Valentine, AFT adds an assortment
            of Nick-Compatible accessories and outfits to Nicks inventory that
            you can see and use to optionally change his look and appearance.  
             
          - Any items assigned to an outfit are protected from Bulk inventory 
            commands. For example, if you say "Give me unused Gear", you will 
            get everything the follower has... except items assigned to one of
            the outfits.  
             
          - Outfits do not have to be different. If nothing else, each outfit
            provides an opportunity to flag an additional weapon as being 
            protected from bulk commands. Many users for example want their
            followers to have a primary, secondary and backup melee weapon
            to account for ammo depletion.

              ----------------------
                  
        DETAILS:  

        a) Combat Style  

           Choose a combat style for your follower to match the 
           archetype you have in mind for the follower. When you
           set a combat style, stats will automatically be 
           redistributed to match the style.  
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Combat Style
                 ----------------------
                 (*) Default
                 ( ) Gunslinger
                 ( ) Bruiser
                 ( ) Commando
                 ( ) Boomstick
                 ( ) Ninja
                 ( ) Sniper
                 ( ) Dynamic
                 ----------------------
                 
           Default:
                 
             Combat AI is not enforced and falls through to whatever
             AI is normally configured. This is useful if you use
             AFT with other combat AI enhancing mods. 
                 
           Gunslinger:
                 
             Holds ground (doesn't close distance or back
             off). Looks for cover and keeps on shooting with a gun.

           Bruiser:

             Prefers closing the distance and fighting hand to hand. 
             Will use melee weapons if they have one that can do more
             damage than their hands. Only uses ranged weapons when 
             they can't seem to reach the enemy. 

           Commando:

             Holds ground (doesn't close distance or back
             off). Generally also doesn't seek cover because of the 
             spin up time of large weapons. This is a good style for 
             followers in power armor.

           Boomstick:

             Prefers closing the distance but then fights with guns 
             looks for cover. IE: Useful for followers who use shotguns 
             like Hancock. 

           Ninja:

             Closes the distance, but then prefers melee weapons. Will 
             also use hands or guns if they can do more damage. Excellent 
             close-combat defense. Trained to use special moves more 
             often.

           Sniper:

             Will back off to increase distance, then seek cover to avoid
             detection. Will almost exclusively use guns. 

           Dynamic:

             Advanced AFT AI. Based on weapons and distance to enemy, 
             switches combat style to optimal settings. You could think
             of this like the coarser setting. Evenly distributes stats
             to remain versatile. 
            

        b) Aggression  
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Style
                 ----------------------
                 [*] Aggressive
                 [ ] Defensive
                 [ ] Auto
                 ----------------------
                 
           AGGRESSIVE:
                 
             Sets follower aggression to "Aggressive". Aggressive Followers 
             attack enemies on sight. (Even if the player is sneaking and
             hasn't been detected yet).
                 
           DEFENSIVE:
                 
             Sets follower aggression to "Unaggressive". Unaggressive Followers
             will not attack anyone unless they are directly attacked first.

           AUTO:
                 
             Sets follower aggression to "Aggressive" however follower 
             automatically changes to Defensive when they player begins
             sneaking. 
                
             ** NOTE : Activating Info (reading a book) ends sneak mode, so 
                INFO will not show Unaggressive when sneaking.
                
        c) Flee Settings
                 
           These settings determine when a follower decides to run from combat. 
           The decision is based on a combination of Follower Health and Enemy 
           Difficulty. 
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Caution
                 ----------------------
                 [ ] Coward
                 [ ] Cautious
                 [ ] Average
                 [ ] Brave
                 [*] Foolhardy
                 ----------------------
                 
           Coward    - Will run at first sign of combat. 
           Cautious  - Fight if Enemy is easy and health > 75%. Otherwise run.
           Average   - Fight until health gets below 50%
           Brave     - Fight until health gets below 25%
           Foolhardy - Fight to the death. 
                 
                 
           NOTE: By default followers are made Foolhardy since they can't 
                 die. However if you set mortality to enable follower death, 
                 Caution automatically changes to Cautious. 
                 
        d) Player Distance
           
           Player Distance does not force distance during combat, but rather
           affects distance outside combat. This will affect how close the follower
           is to the player when combat begins

                 ----------------------
                 Player Distance
                 ----------------------
                 [X] Scout Ahead
                 ( ) Near
                 (*) Medium
                 ( ) Far
                 ----------------------
           
           [X] SCOUT Ahead
             
             Should the follower attempt to stay in front of the player? In this
             mode, Near/Med/Far determine how far ahead of the player. Dogmeat
             uses scout ahead by default. However AFT allows you to enable or 
             disable this behavior on any companions you want.
             
           NEAR: ( about 8 feet away)
             
             Sets the follower AI to remain close to the player when exploring.
             This setting affects proximity of NPC to Player when combat begins. 
             Distance during combat is actually determined by the Combat AI Style. 
             
           MEDIUM: ( about 16 feet away)
                 
             Sets the follower AI to remain moderately close to the player 
             when exploring. This setting affects proximity of NPC to Player 
             when combat begins. Distance during combat is actually determined 
             by the Combat AI Style.
                 
             This is the games default distance.
                 
           FAR: ( about 32 feet away).
                 
             Sets the follower AI to keep their distance from the player when 
             exploring. This setting affects proximity of NPC to Player when 
             combat begins. Distance during combat is actually determined 
             by the Combat AI Style.
             
        e) [ ] PA Helmet Toggle
                 
           Toggled on to have the follower automatically un-equip the helmet of
           their PowerArmor when outside combat and put it back on when combat
           begins. 
                  
           When traveling with multiple followers wearing PowerArmor, I found
           this necessary as it was hard to tell who was who without being able
           to see their faces. 
                 
        f) [ ] Ignore Friendly Hits
                  
           Determines if follower will react to friendly fire. By default, 
           Followers have this option checked. However if you want a more 
           immersive experience, you can uncheck the value. 
                 
           When unchecked, if you hit a follower a certain number of times, 
           they will automatically dismiss themselves and turn hostile. When 
           this happens, you must distance yourself from them and wait 24 
           hours (game time) before approaching them again. 

        g) > Global Settings
                  
           Takes you to the Global Combat Settings window. See below for 
           more detail.              
             
     4) Info
                  
        Scan followers to learn things about them. You can generate a full 
        report (ALL) or generate a report for a specific area using the menu
        options:

              Keywords
              ----------------------
              
        a) All
             
           Scans for everything and returns a "book" that contains all known
           information regarding the NPC. The scan normally takes 5 to 10 secs.
             
        b) Stats
             
           Scans for SPECIAL attributes (Strength, Perception, Endurance, 
           Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck) as well as Resistances and
           overall health. Also reveals kill count of each follower.
             
        c) Relationship 
             
           Relationship: 
             
             A single term that summarizes your current relationship with the 
             follower:
             
                Hate, Disdain, Neutral, Friend, Admiration,  Confidant, 
                Infatuated, In Love
             
           Romance Option: 
             
             Indicates if the follower Can be romanced
             
           Is Romanced:
             
             Indicates if follower is currently in a romance with the player. 
             
           Player Opinion:
             
             Provides score which reflects how much the follower likes or 
             dislikes the player based on an accumulation of observed actions
             and traits. The score ranges from -1100 to 1100 
             
             Most followers start off at 0. At certain threshold points, the 
             follower relationship may shift from say... Neutral to Friend or
             Neutral to Disdain.  The closest thresholds are provided above and
             below the Player Opinion score to show how close you are from a 
             relationship shift in the positive or negative direction.  
             
             Relationship shifts are normally (but not always) accompanied by 
             Companion specific comments, conversations and scenes. 
             
        d) Reactions:
             
           Provides a comprehensive list of actions and events that Fallout 4
           monitors and shows the selected Follower's reaction to those events.
           
           See Section "V.A Recognized Reactions" below for full listing
             
           Ratings are color coded for easier reading. Like's are colored Green
           while dislikes are colored red.  
             
        e) AI
               
           Aggression:
             
             Determines when or if your followers will attack other characters. 
             
             - Unaggressive:    Only attack if hit by another NPC
             - Aggressive:      Attack enemies on Sight
             - Very Aggressive: Attack non-allies on Sight
             - Frenzied:        Attack everyone on sight
             
           Confidence:
             
             Confidence determines how low your followers health can get before 
             they begin to run from a fight. 
             
             - Cowardly:        No damage necessary. Immediately Run
             - Cautious:        Run if health below 75%
             - Average:         Run if health below 50% 
             - Brave:           Run if health below 75%
             - Foolhardy:       Never Run
             
           Assistance:
             
             Assistance determines who a follower will "Follow into" combat.
             For example, the player is considers a friend and an ally. Even if
             your followers aggression is set to Unaggressive, they may begin
             fighting when the player takes a hit, even though they didn't 
             receive it directly. 
             
             - Help No One:   Never enter combat because of someone else.
             - Helps Allies:  Assist anyone belonging to a friendly group.
             - Helps Friends: Help "friends" regardless of group association.
             
           Morality: 
             
             Morality controls whether an NPCs will commit crimes or refuse 
             commands against certain people, groups or owned containers.
             
             - No Crime:        Wont do anything considered unethical
             - Property Crime:  Will steal from owned containers
             - Violent Crime:   Will attack Non-allies + Property Crime
             - Any Crime:       Will attack Allies + Violent Crime
               
        f) Traits
             
             
           Race:
             
             Some NPCs can change their race as part of the game (Most notably
             Curie). AFT also allows you to change follower race for 
             appearance. AFT tracks both original race and current race. 
             
             By default, synths are treated as Humans and display as Humans to
             prevent spoiling quests. The AFT Settings holotape includes a 
             setting to reveal Synths under Misc Settings. 
             
           Home Location:
             
             Managed NPCs will have an Original and Current Home location. The
             Current Home Location is the place that the Follower will go if 
             they are dismissed.
             
           Unique: 
             
             This is a technical trait that indicates only 1 copy of that 
             specific NPC is allowed in the game. (No duplicates).
             
             Generally speaking, NPC's with unique names are unique. This 
             Property is necessary for the Sculpt system to work.
             
           Templated:
             
             Templated characters are normally generated by scripts and involve
             randomized elements. IE: a head from here, an outfit from there, a 
             weapon from somewhere. NPCs that show up at your settlements are 
             generally templated. 
             
             The game continuously enforces the traits of templated NPCs. For 
             this reason, you generally can't change their appearance. Sculpt 
             and Set Name wont work for example. (They work very briefly, but 
             the NPCs changes back so fast all you see is a blink).
             
             Curie is a special case and has special code to defeat this
             limit. But in general, you can't sculpt a templated NPC. 
             
             Curie also includes a special "New Body" menu where you can 
             assign an entirely new pre-fab face/Body from a small collection 
             we created. 

           Managed Slot

            The "Slot" or ID within AFT that the NPC is using. A number between
            1 and 32. This can be useful if you wish to setup targetted hotkeys.
			See the HotKeys section below for more details.
             
        g) Effects
             
           AFT may not be able to account for every item, potion, recipe or 
           perk mod  you install, but under the hood most of these mods end up
           applying one of a few dozen effects. This screen lists these lower
           level general effects. You will typically see some overlap between 
           what you see here and in other areas such as Perks.
             
           See section V.B "Recognized Effects" below
           for a full listing of detected effects. 
                          
        h) Factions
             
           A Faction is a named group or organization. For example, there is
           faction for Diamond City and a faction for the Brotherhood of Steel. 
           A Faction for raiders and a faction for Synths. Much of the fighting
           that occurs in Fallout 4 is due to Faction membership and the 
           relationships defined between the factions. 
             
           When a follower is a member of a faction, they may show loyalty to
           that faction by attacking other NPCs on sight because they are a 
           member of an enemy faction. They may also refuse to attack other
           faction members. 
                         
           Here, we show what factions the NPC is/was a member of. 
             
           See section V.C "Recognized Factions" below for a full listing of 
           detected Factions. 
             
           NOTES:
             
           AFT removes followers from all factions to ensure loyalty and avoid
           unintended hostilities. When used on a managed NPC, the factions 
           shown reflect a snapshot of the follower's factions BEFORE they 
           joined the player. If you are scanning an unmanaged NPC, then 
           Factions will be current.
           
        i) Perks
             
           Player Perks are well known, get cool names and are chosen by the
           player as the player levels up. NPC perks are less glamorous, more
           limited and also generally very direct. You will see perks for 
           things like adding damage resistance or increasing attack damage.
             
           See section V.D "Recognized Perks" below for a full listing of 
           detected Perks. 
                          
        j) Keywords
              
           Keywords are small nuggets of information used in making AI 
           decisions. For example, there is a keyword that allows an NPC to
           attempt to pick locks. Keywords can also be used to determine things
           like which seat of the Vertibird the NPC will climb into. Some 
           keywords operate like spell effects. The keyword ImmuneFrenzy grants
           immunity to frenzy just like a spell could.
             
           Keywords are broad in scope, but as they are so heavily used by the
           game engine, we felt it was worthwhile to scan for the most common 
           ones and show them.

           See section V.E "Recognized Keywords" below for a full listing of 
           detected Keywords. 
                          
     5) Appearance
             
        The Appearance menu offers number of ways you can customize your 
        followers appearance. Some commands such as Scale will work against
        any NPC or creature. Other commands like Sculpt are very picky and will
        only work with Humans and Ghouls who are both unique and non-templated.
        Most commands are neither as lenient as Scale or as strict as Sculpt 
        and fall somewhere in the middle. 
                 
        For these reasons, some companions are more customizable than others, 
        but every NPC can be customized to some degree

              ----------------------
                   
        a) Pose  
                   
           The Pose Menu contains a number of options for posing the NPC. 
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Pose
                 ----------------------
                 Browse
                 > Select
                 Move/Rotate
                 Stop
                 ----------------------
             
             You can only pose humanoid companions. This option will not appear
             if the follower is a dog or non-humanoid robot like a Mr. Handy.
                 
           BROWSE:
                 
             Visually browse the various poses applied to the NPC and choose 
             the one you wish to use or cancel. On selection, begins a Dialogue
             Scene where the Right and Left options cycle poses and the up and
             down options choose/exit.
                 
           SELECT:
                 
             Brings up a list of all Poses and allows you to jump directly to a
             named pose without going through the Pose Browser (saves time).
                 
           MOVE/ROTATE:
                 
             NPC position becomes locked to the player so that as the player 
             moves so does the NPC (like picking them up). Dialogue menu arrows
             allow you to rotate, lean and shift the follower in small detailed
             increments for fine-grained placement. 
                 
           STOP:  
                 
             Ends the current Pose.
                 
           NOTES: 
                 
             If you pose an ACTIVE follower, the pose will automatically end
             once you get more than about 15 feet from them. 
                 
        b) Scale 
                 
           The Scale Menu contains a number of options for changing the size of
           an NPC. Worn items such as clothes and power armor will scale up or 
           down to match the Follower.
                          
                 ----------------------
                 Scale
                 ----------------------
                 200 %
                 150 %
                 125 %
                 105 %
                 95 %
                 80 %
                 66 %
                 50 %
                 Reset
                 ----------------------
                 
           PERCENTAGE:
                 
             If the value is greater than 100%, the NPC will get larger. If the
             value is less than 100%, the NPC will get smaller.
                 
           RESET:
                 
             Returns the NPC to their original proportions. This is the only 
             command that ignores the Followers current size. 
                 
           NOTES: 
                 
             Scale is always based on the Followers CURRENT size. So if you 
             scale a follower to 200% twice, they will be %400. You can mix 
             and match commands to achieve values outside the 8 listed above. 
                 
        c) Parts 
                 
           While the SCULPT command insists on Human or Ghoul races, the PARTS
           command is less picky. It uses papyrus commands to force models onto
           the NPC and can even offer access to content not available from the 
           sculpt command. For example, you can assign hair to Nick, a beard
           to Cait or Synth Eyes to Preston. We can even make Piper look like 
           Nate (with some scaling). The parts command has no restrictions. 
                          
                 ----------------------
                 Parts
                 ----------------------
                 Hair
                 Eyes
                 Beard
                 Face
                 ----------------------
                 
           HAIR: 
                 
             Use Dialog Arrows to browse the Hair styles applied to the NPC 
             and choose one.
                 
           Eyes: 
                 
             Use Dialog Arrows to browse the Eye styles applied to the NPC 
             and choose one.
                 
           Beard:
                 
             Use Dialog Arrows to browse the Beard styles applied to the NPC 
             and choose one.
                 
           Face: 
                 
             Use Dialog Arrows to browse the Prefab Face Meshes and choose 
             one.
                 
           NOTES:
                 
             The first time you use PARTS/SCULPT against an NPC, AFT unlocks 
             the FACE for editing. The technical trick we use to do this 
             removes any existing EXTRAS added to the face (blemishes, scars, 
             freckles, etc...). You can of coarse add them back, though you 
             may not know exactly what they were. You will recieve a 
             confirmation prompt regarding this when you use either of those
             two commands. 
                  
        d) Race
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Race
                 ----------------------
                 Human
                 SynthGen1 
                 SynthGen2
                 Dog
                 Rabid Dog
                 FEV Dog
                 ----------------------
                  
           AFT allows you to change the racial appearance of your follower. For
           example you can use AFT to make Hancock a much more attractive human
           for those wanting to romance him. You can turn Codsworth into a 
           Human (Synth) so that he can operate PowerArmor and be a more 
           effective fighter. You can turn strong into a Behemoth or a talking
           Dog (both relatively entertaining). 
                  
           AFT restricts the available options on a per-companion basis to 
           those deemed "safe". So for example, Piper has very few options 
           because testing revealed she wasn't compatible with most races.  
             
        e) Voice
           
                 ----------------------
                 Voice

                 ----------------------
           
           When you use AFT to force recruit other non-player characters, sometimes
           those characters are silent and have nothing to say. The Voice option
           allows you to assign a Voice to a companion that falls into that category. 
           
           This option only appears on force recruited NPCs.

                Sentry Bot
                Assaultron
            
        f) Sculpt/Edit Body
                  
           The Sculpt command starts up the games surgery menu, only with the 
           companion as the target instead of the Player.  This is the same 
           editor you used to customize the players appearance when the game 
           started. So it allows full editing of the appearance from hair color
           to facial blemishes. 
                  
           Unfortunately, the built-in surgery menu only supports humans and 
           Ghouls. If you try to plug in any other race (supermutant, synth, 
           MrHandy), it will crash the game. Therefore AFT does checks and only
           presents the menu if the race is human or ghoul. 
                  
           Sometimes, this command will say "Edit Body". That means that AFT 
           has determined that edits to the NPC's face will likely fail, but 
           you can still use the Surgery Menu to change the body proportions. 
           This is most common with randomly generated NPCs you pick up at 
           settlements and random encounters. 
                  
           NOTES: 
                  
             The first time you use PARTS/SCULPT against an NPC, AFT unlocks 
             the FACE for editing. The technical trick we use to do this 
             removes any existing EXTRAS added to the face (blemishes, scars, 
             freckles, etc...). You will receive a confirmation prompt 
             regarding this when you use either of those two commands. 
                  
        g) Posture 
                   
           Posture is the stance that the follower takes when they are 
           relaxing. Some NPCs such as Mama Murphey use the elderly posture. 
           You can change the NPC's posture if you wish to add or remove 
           behavior. Note: You wont really notice unless the Follower relaxes.  
                  
        h) Expression
                  
           Expression is a visual representation of someone's mood. Like
           posture, it only gets used when the follower relaxes and even then
           it may be so brief that it is easy to miss.
                  
        i) New Body
                   
           Currently, NEW BODY only appears with Curie and only if you complete
           her quest to become a synth. It allows you to assign Curie to one of
           several pre-fabricated bodies/face combos. This may become available
           on other robotic companions in a future version.
            
        j) Reset
      
           From time to time, NPC's animations can become broken. For example, 
           if you leave Piper's apartment while she is smoking a cigarette, 
           a cell detach bug in the game can cause Piper to forever attempt
           smoking cigarettes when at idle. 
      
           This command can be used to correct broken animation issues. It can
           also correct behavior issues if they are related to a stuck animation.
           
           Reset brings up a menu with two options. 
     
           Light Reset: This is always recommended as a first step. It simply 
           disables and reenables the NPC, forcing the game to reload their model
           and animation data.
       
		   Full Reset: When a Light Reset doesn't fix your issue, you can try
           a full reset. This command resets the NPC back to their begin-game
           state. It immitates the console command recycleactor, but unlike the 
           console command, it takes a snapshot of the NPC and attempts
           to restore them after recycling the actor. Gear, outfits and keywords
           (relationship progress) are saved off and then restored after the NPC
           is reset.

     6) Settings

            Stat Effects:

              Strength : Carry Weight boosted by 10 pts for each stat allocated. 
                         So with a strength of 5, the follower will receive a 
                         boost of 50. At 25, the follower receives a max boost  
                         of 250. (Game also provides melee damage boost)

              Perception : Each stat allocated over 10 adds 10% damage to 
                           attacks using ranged weapons. So at 11, the follower
                           does 110% damage with guns. At 25, the follower 
                           does 250% damage with guns. 

              Endurance : Each stat allocated over 5 adds 25 points of health.
                          So at 10, the follower gets a health boost of 125 
                          and at 25, the boost is 500.

              Charisma  : The player receives a synergy bonus for every 10 
                          points allocated to active followers beyond the base 
                          value of 5. So at 15, the player gets +1 charisma and
                          at 25, the player gets +2. If the player has 5 active
                          followers all with 25 charisma, the boost is 10 points

              Intelligence : AFT does not add any additional benefits beyond 
                             those naturally granted with high intelligence. 

              Agility   : Each stat allocated (over base value 5) adds 3 damage
                          resistance to follower. So at 10, the follower gets 
                          15 damage resistance and at 25, the follower gets 60 
                          damage resistance.

              Luck      : The player receives a synergy bonus for every 10 
                          points allocated to active followers beyond the base 
                          value of 5. So at 15, the player gets +1 luck and at 
                          25, the player gets +2. If the player has 5 active 
                          followers all with 25 luck, the boost is 10 points

           NOTES: A max of 25 is enforced for any specific stat.

                  Minimum total = 25 + level up to level 50 so that
                  at level 50, the minimum will be 75. After level
                  50 the minimum grows every other level. So at
                  level 100, the minimum will be 100.


        b) Assign Name
                 
           Select one of 60 unique names to assign to your followers. For 
           example, give Dogmeat your own unique name. This is particularly
           handy when importing NPCs that have generic names like "Settler",
           "Guard" and "Resident".  It will also work against the original
           13 companions.
                  
           What to Expect:
                 
           - When bringing up the PipBoy, the assigned name will always appear
             at the top. 
                    
           - AFT also attempts to change the name that appears when you hover 
             the target hair over the NPC. However this can sometimes fail if 
             the NPC is currently being used by a higher priority quest/script
             at the time you attempt to assign the name. (See Notes)
                 
           NOTES: 
                     
             When you ring a settlement Bell to summon all settlers, a high
             quest/script directs all the NPCs assigned to the settlement to 
             the bell. For this reason, you should almost never attempt to name 
             an NPC while a settlement bell is in effect.
                      
             The best way to avoid this specific issue is to sleep for a few 
             hours before attempting to name your companions.  
                 
             The target hair name change is less likely to work for core 
             companions if you in the middle of their personal quest.
                  
             I've never gotten the Target Hair Name to change for Curie. Not
             sure why.
                 
        c) Assign Home
                 
           Selecting this option will pop up a message box that prompts you for
           a Home location. This is the location that the Follower will return
           to when they are dismissed.
                 
           Your options can include:
                 
             - Original Home Location
             - Settlement
             - Camp
             - Current Location
                 
           The message will include the name of the original home location so 
           you know where you would be sending them. 
                 
           Settlement will pop up yet another menu so you can select one of 
           your settlements.
                 
           CAMP will only appear if you have setup camp at some point in the 
           past. 
                 
        d) Personality
                 
           The original 13 "core" companions all come with reactions to things
           they like and don't like. This can make traveling with some of them
           difficult. So AFT includes some tweaks to help ease the friction.
                 
                 ----------------------

                 [ ] Convert Like/Love to Dislike/Hate
                 ----------------------
                              
           [ ] Disable Dislike/Hate
                 
             You can have followers simply ignore things they normally don't 
             like. NOTE That ignoring something will not stop the commentary. 
             It will simply stop the Player Opinion score from dropping. 
                 
           [ ] Disable Like/Love
                 
             You can have followers simply ignore things they normally like 
             or love. NOTE That ignoring something will not stop the commentary. 
             It will simply stop the Player Opinion score from increasing. 
                 
           [ ] Convert Dislike/Hate to Like/Love
                 
             This setting will actual cause the relationship to improve when 
             you do things the NPC normally doesn't like. For example, stepping
             into PowerArmor while traveling with Strong. 
                 
             For immersion, this setting automatically disables negative
             commentary from the NPC. If you wish to hear the negative comments
             despite  the reaction reversal, you can uncheck Ignore Negative 
             Comments in the Commentary section after you enable this.  
                 
           [ ] Convert Like/Love to Dislike/Hate
                 
             This setting will actual cause the relationship to diminish when 
             you do things the NPC normally likes. For example, helping
             settlements while traveling with Preston. 
                 
             For immersion, this setting automatically disables positive
             commentary from the NPC. If you wish to hear the positive comments
             despite  the reaction reversal, you can uncheck Ignore Negative 
             Comments in the Commentary section after you enable this.  
                 
        e) Chat Settings
                 
           The original 13 "core" companions all come pre-configured with things
           they say in response to what they observe. With up to 5 companions, 
           there can be a lot of NPCs all talking at once. So AFT includes 
           commentary management.

           [ ] Disable Negative Comments
                 
             The follower will no longer say things when they observe something
             they don't like. Checking this setting alone will not stop their 
             opinion score from decreasing. This toggle only stops the 
             commentary.
                 
           [ ] Disable General Comments
                 
             The follower will no longer say things about the mundane things
             they observe such as looting corpses or taking radiation damage. 
                 
           [ ] Disable Positive Comments
                 
             The follower will no longer say things when they observe something
             they like. Note that checking this setting alone will not stop 
             their opinion score from increasing. This toggle only stops the 
             commentary
                 
           [ ] Disable Activator Comments
                 
             The follower will no longer say things when you activate them 
             using the AFT activator.

                 AI Tweaks
                 ----------------------
                 [ ] Sync PowerArmor use w/Player
                 [ ] Sync Weapon use w/Player
                 [ ] Avoid Traps
                 [ ] Disable AutoRelax
                 [ ] Track Kills
                 ----------------------
                 
           [ ] Sync PowerArmor use w/Player
                 
             When toggled, the follower will enter and exit their assigned 
             Power Armor when the player enter and exits power armor.
                 
           [ ] Sync Weapon use w/Player
                 
             When toggled, the follower will draw there weapon when they see 
             the player draw a weapon. When not toggled, they will wait until 
             they see a threat.
                 
             Defaults for core companions are based on background and 
             personality. For example, Danse is military trained, so he draws 
             with the player. Meanwhile, Hancock is laid back, so he doesn't. 
             You can of coarse change the settings if you wish. 
                 
           [ ] Disable Auto Relax
                 
             Toggle this setting to prevent the specific follower from 
             auto relaxing when you holster your weapon. This is the 
             individualized version. There is a global version under
             the AFT Settings Holotape. 
                          
           [ ] Avoid Traps
                 
             When toggled, Followers will not set off physical traps even if 
             they accidentally run into them (including mines).

           [ ] Track Kills

             AFT begins tracking kills for the NPC during combat. This option 
             uses ONHIT events for tracking, so it may cause lag on slower 
             machines. Kill Count can be seen under INFO -> Stats
                 
        g) [ ] Enable Pack Mule
                 
             When toggled on, follower carry capacity increased to 2000 lbs. 
                 
        h) [ ] Unlimited Ammo

           Check to cause follower to have unlimited ammo

        i) [ ] No PA Damage

           Check to prevent damage to Follower PA. 

        j) [ ] Allow Follower Death
                 
             Name says it all. Toggle will allow followers to die. NOTE: (Nick, 
             Dogmeat and Piper are essential until certain game milestones are
             complete.)
                        
     7) Tools    
      
        The Tools Menu is actually a Global menu available under both Follower
         Mode and All Follower Mode. Access is included from Follower Mode primarily
        as a convenience. See See section C.3 below for more details. 
                                    
     8) Follower Selection
             
        Allows you to switch to ALL FOLLOWERS mode. In ALL FOLLOWERS mode,  only 
        commands are shown that can be applied to all active followers.
             
             
     9) Force Recruit NPC

        Forces the NPC to become a follower, fully managed by AFT. 

     10) AFT should ignore this follower

        This option will mark the NPC so that AFT will ignore them. Selecting 
        this will cause the "Force Recruit NPC" option to disappear. If you 
        can talk to the NPC and ask them to follow you, AFT will not fully 
        import them and treat them as an "Unmanaged" follower. This is the 
        same behavior that occurs if you reach the managed follower limit 
        (32) and ask someone new to follow you through conversation. 

  C. AFT Activator : All Follower Mode     

     We start all follower mod by Activating the AFT Activator when the 
     crosshair is NOT located on any NPC. The following Menu will appear:
      
         ----------------------

              Setup Camp \ Teardown Camp
              --------------------------
             
        DETAILS:
                             
        a) Gather Loose Items
             
           Followers search around the player (Radius = 1.5X the size of 
           AFT CAMP) and gather up any items they see. If the crosshair
           is on a specific follower, they will receive the items. If the
           cross hair is not on any follower, then the preference will
           be:

           1) Dogmeat : If dogmeat is a companion, he is preferred as the
              holder of gear because he will not attempt to use any of it
              and for most users, they can scrap or sell everything in 
              dogmeats inventory without having to worry about messing up
              an outfit.

           2) Random Companion : If you do not have dogmeat but at least 1
              AFT managed companion, then one of your companions will be
              randomly chosen to hold the gear. 

           3) The player : If you are playing solo and have no companions, 
              the items will be funneled to your own inventory. This may 
              be dangerous if you are playing in survival mode.

           Progress messages will be shown (normally less than 5 seconds)
           with a summary of discovered items as well as items ignored because
           they were owned or containers that were locked. 

           NOTE : Gather Loose Items is a time saving convenience method
                  and ignores followers carry weight limits. If you are
                  opposed to followers carrying more than their limit 
                  allows, then don't use this method. 

        b) Unlock Visible
		
		   AFT assesses what is in front of the player, searching for locked
		   doors, containers or terminals. Then looks at your companions and
		   selects the one best suited for the job. This helps avoid the 
		   need for command mode or placing the crosshair over the item 
		   that needs to be unlocked. An excellent command to link to a 
		   favorite or hotkey if the player does not prefer to unlock things.
		   
           If you have 2 people in your party that can unlock something, then
           the first recruited will be preferred over the other. To change 
           AFT's preference, dismiss everyone and then ask the NPC you prefer,
           to follow you first. Then ask the others. 
		   
        c) Summon All
             
           Teleports all active followers in front of you and causes
           them to begin following you again if they were told to 
           wait/hangout or individually stay somewhere.
              
           Note: 
           
           - There are some areas of the game where Summon All is disabled
             for immersion reasons.
                
        d) Command Mode
          
           Places the previously commanded actor back into command
           mode. Activating a second time toggles command mode off.
           Recommend using as a HOTKEY.
                      
        e) All Retreat
           
           Causes all followers to stop fighting and retreat for 20 
           seconds.
             
           After 20 seconds, they will continue to fight and defend
           themselves unless you renew the command with another call.

        f) All Attack
          
           Typically used when sneaking to have your followers attack 
           nearby enemies that have not yet spotted you. (You want everyone
           else to attack so the attention is not on you). It can also be
           used to cancel a retreat that is in progress.
             
           All Attack will direct your followers to attack any non-allies.
           This can include neutral NPCs such as merchants, so use with 
           caution.
             
        g) All Wait
          
           All followers enter WAIT Mode. (As if you walked up to them
           and told them to STAY)
           
        h) All Hangout

           All followers begin to Wait and Sandbox. Command overrides
           followers individual Auto Relax settings.

        i) All Follow

           All followers begin to Follow the player. This command will
           cancel individual states like STAY HERE.

        j) All Dismiss
          
           Dismisses all followers after presenting you with a 
           confirmation prompt. 

        k) All Enter Power Armor

           Any follower with an assigned Power Armor who is not already 
           wearing it will immediately enter their power armor. Followers
           will run up to it if it is nearby or the PA will teleport to 
           them if it is not.

           POWER ARMOR ASSIGNEMENT:
           
               To assign a PowerArmor to a follower simply have them enter a
               power armor. Assignment occurs when they enter. 

               For those unfamiliar with the process, Start Command-Mode by 
               "grabbing" the follower from a distance. On PC, you use the [e]
               key by default. This will cause the target hair to show context
               sensitive information based on what the target hair is hovering 
               over. Hover over a PowerArmor and tell the Follower to Enter. 
             
               This assigns the PowerArmor to the Follower. It will remain  
               assigned until another NPC or the player enters the PowerArmor. 
             
               The easiest way to un-assign PowerArmor is to have the player
               enter a followers PA.

        l) All Exit Power Armor

           Any follower wearing Power Armor will immediately exit.
             

        m) Fetch My PowerArmor
           
           Causes the players PowerArmor to teleport to the Player, as if a
           follower fetched it.

        n) Setup\Teardown Camp
           
           "Setup": 
             
             Appears if Camp is not already setup. The command scans the 
             terrain around you and builds camp based on characteristics.
             Construction can take up to a minute depending on what you have 
             enabled and purchased.
           
           "Teardown": 
           
             Appears if Camp is currently setup. If you issue the command in 
             the vicinity of camp, camp will immediately begin to fade. 
             Teardown can take up to two minutes depending on the complexity of 
             Your camp and what you have purchased/enabled.
           
             If you issue Teardown when you are away from camp, a 24 hour delay
             penalty is added. (1 game day). This is to simulate the amount of 
             time it would take your followers to return to camp, tear it down
             and return to you.  Activating Teardown a second time while the 
             penalty window is active will tell you how much time is left 
             before camp is available. You can cancel the penalty by returning
             to camp and issuing the command from camp itself. 
           
           NOTES : 
           
             Special things happen the first time you setup camp. See the Aft 
             Camp section below for more details. 
           
     2) Gear
           
        Use this menu to configure outfits or issue commands for bulk inventory
        management. 
           
              ----------------------
              Gear
              ----------------------
              Unequip All
              Give me ALL Junk
              Give me ALL Scrap
              Give me ALL Unused Gear
              Give me ALL Gear
              ----------------------
                 
        DETAILS:   

        a) Unequip All
                 
           The command is pretty self explanatory. A few notes: 
                 
           - If a follower is in PowerArmor, they will exit the PowerArmor, 
             unequip all and then Re-enter the PowerArmor to avoid PowerArmor
             related glitches.
                 
           - Following the command, only PLAYABLE items will be visible in 
             the followers inventory. If the follower was wearing unplayable
             items, you may not be able to re-equip them. AFT includes fixes
             for some NPCs such as Nick Valentine. Other NPCs such as Deacon
             may need new clothes (and a wig). Saving is recommended before 
             using the command.
                 
        b) Give me ALL Junk
             
             Transfers all the JUNK to the player (this includes scrap). 
             
        c) Give me ALL Scrap
             
             Transfers only raw scrap to the player. Does NOT transfer 
             non-scrapped Junk.
                
        d) Give me ALL Unused Gear
             
             Transfers any items that are not assigned to a follower outfit to 
             the player. 
                
        e) Give me ALL Gear

             Transfers all follower items to the player, even those belonging
             to an outfit.
          
        NOTES:
          
          - If an outfit has a weapon, the ammo that the weapon uses is also 
            considered part of the outfit even if the ammo wasn't equipped 
            when the outfit was created.
                       
     3) Tools
      
              ----------------------
              Tools
              ----------------------
              > Locate Managed NPC
              > Settlement
              > Unmanage NPC
              > Global Settings
              > QUEST: Camp Expansion
              ----------------------
              
        a) Locate Managed NPC

           A menu will appear listing the names of all managed/tracked NPCs. 
           Select a name and a quest will begin to locate the selected NPC. 
           Follow the quest objective marker to find the NPC.
                  
           Approaching the NPC and getting within touching distance ends the 
           quest.      
                        
        b) Settlement
                  
           The Settlement Tools only appear when you are in a settlement. 
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Settlement
                 ----------------------
                 > Clear Settlement
                 Reset Build Limit
                 > Load Prefab
                 > Save Prefab
                 ----------------------             
                 
           CLEAR SETTLEMENT:
             
             Used to quickly scrap a settlement. By default, it will scrap 
             everything, that can be scrapped and transfer it to the settlement 
             workbench. 
                    
             The method takes you to a page of options where you can filter
             what you would like to remove.  For example, you may wish to leave
             things you can't re-create with the Workshop like living trees. 
             
             Removing items from settlements when settlers are assigned 
             to them can lead to crashing and game instability. Therefore, 
             ClearSettlement (may) unassign all the settlers from their current
             tasks if the cleared items include food, beds or other 
             assignable objects. 

             The recommendation is to manually store all food sources
             (plants) before issuing the command. Conversely, you can 
             filter out food items from the Clear Settlement filters. 
             
           RESET BUILD LIMIT
             
             If you are working on a settlement and your size bar fills up, you
             can issue this command the reset it to 0.
             
           LOAD PREFAB
             
             Searches for any installed Prefabs and displays them one at a 
             time. By Default MOST settlements have at least 1 Prefab that
             includes a Wall Only and Full Build option (See credits below for
             list of default prefabs included with AFT and their prices)
             
             Prefabs cost money, but don't forget you can use Clear Settlement 
             in conjunction with the "Sell all gear" command to quickly convert 
             settlement scrap into caps.

             When loading a prefab, if Food sources are detected, you will
             receive a warning, but it will allow you to proceed. SHould you
             decide to proceed, it will unassign all settlers from their 
             current tasks. If you want to avoid this, make sure you clear all
             food sources before attempting to load the Prefab. 

             Wall Only Prefabs do not include housing, defenses, electricity, 
             food or water. They also generally do not clear the settlement.

             Full build Prefabs always include a Wall. If the Wall is 
             purchased first, the cost of the wall is subtracted from the 
             Prefab. 
             
             By default, AFT Does not include Prefabs for Bunker Hill, Covenant 
             Or the Boston AirPort. However AFT Addon-Mods may become available
             that expand the selection for those areas.
                    
           SAVE PREFAB     
                    
             This option only appears if you are running the PC version 
             of the mod. Furthermore, for the command to work, logging
             must be enabled which requires additional steps (See "III.E 
             Creating Your Own Settlement Snapshots" below).

               a progress bar to indicate time until completion. Typically 
               takes about a minute. When finished, it will tell you the name 
               of the log file  (Basically the name of the settlement). 
                  
                  For an example see the link:

             - TO PAPYRUS:
                     
               On Activation, takes a "snapshot" of the current settlement with
               a progress bar to indicate time until completion. Typically 
               takes about a minute. When finished, it will tell you the name 
               of the log file with the code in it (Basically the name of the 
               settlement). 
                     
               Papyrus is used when you wish to export your settlement as another
                  option visible within AFT. You must use the code in a series of 
                  additional steps to create an addon mod (Requires Creation kit)
               The steps are outlined below in:

               "Section IX: Making an AFT addon mod"

               When the steps are followed, the settlement will become a new 
               Option within AFT and can even be distributed to Consoles such 
               as XBOX. 
                     
             NOTES:  
                     
               AFT prefabs only support a limited set of items. (About 1200 items in 
                  total). By default, the list includes all constructable and scrapable 
                  vanilla game items as well as a handful of non-constructable/scrap-able
                  items. A simple way to see what will be included in the snapshot is to 
               use Tools -> Settlement -> ClearSettlement. Any items remaining 
               after Clear Settlement will not be included in the Save.  
               
               Starting with version 1.17, Automatron, Far Harbor and Nuka World 
               DLC items are supported in their corresponding DLC areas. However
               DLC items will not work outside areas that belong to the DLC. For 
               example, the Barn Kit that comes with Far Harbor will only be 
               recorded if the prefab is for a Far Harbor settlement.
                  
               Starting with version 1.17, AFT Prefab Addon Mods (Papyrus only) 
               can include their own custom resources (furnitures, walls, etc..)
               and use them within the settlement(s) provided by the addon mod. 
                  
        c) Unmanage NPC
                    
           If the target hair was on an NPC before issuing the command, that
           NPC will be unmanaged. If the target hair was not on an NPC, A menu
           will appear listing the names of all managed NPCs. Select a name 
           and AFT will unmanage the follower, making their slot available
           for someone else. 
                     
           When an NPC is unmanaged, AFT attempts to undo any changes made to
           the NPC to the maximum extent possible. This includes restoring any 
           "Original" values such as factions, race and body parts. Some 
           changes can not be undone. For example, changes made using the 
           sculpt menu.
                    
        d) Global Settings

           Opens up Global Settings. Note that global settings can also be 
           accessed via the AFT Setting holotape. Access to Global Settings
           through the Tools menu was added mostly to support VR. 
           
           See "E. Global Settings" below for more details on Global Settings.

        e) QUEST: Camp Expansion
                       
           This option appears while the AFT Camp Expansion quest is running. 
           Selecting this menu will give you a summary of the current task and
           offer a buy-out option if you have the caps. Once AFT Camp Expansion
           is complete, this menu option goes away. (Camp can be further 
           expanded with purchases from the Camp Terminal)
                          
     4) Select Follower
             
        Opens a menu that lists all active followers. (even followers who are 
        waiting somewhere far away). This allows you to remotely issue commands
        even when you can't reach them
                          
  D. AFT Activator : Import/Recruitment Mode
  
     The Import/Recruitment Menu will appear if you use the AFT Activator on
     an NPC who is not managed by AFT. 
      
         ----------------------
         [Recruit NPC]:
         ----------------------
         Scan NPC
         Make Follower (Full Import)
         Make Follower (Leave AI intact)
         Make Follower (Follow Only. DO NOT MANAGE)
		 Make Settler/UnMake Settler
         Ignored NPC
         Cancel
         ----------------------      
      
      NOTES:
      
      - Import will work on any NPC who is not actively hostile towards the 
        Player. 
        
      - DO NOT use Import on core companions such as Ada, Cait, Curie, 
        Codsworth, Danse, Deacon, Dogmeat, Gage, Hancock, Long Fellow, MacCready, 
        Nick Valentine, Piper, Preston, Strong, X6-88. You should recruit
        core companions normally through regular dialog. 
        
     1) Scan NPC
      
        Examines the NPC and brings up an INFO SCAN report. Used to evaluate
        if an NPC is worth making a follower or not. 
      
     2) Make Follower (Full Import)

        If you force recruit a BOS soldier and an Institute Synth, under normal
        conditions they would open fire on each other. FULL import ensures no 
        internal fighting between followers by stripping away the NPCs original 
        AI and replacing it with AFT's custom AI.
      
     3) Make Follower (Leave AI intact)
      
        Fully imports the follower into AFT EXCEPT it leaves their AI intact. 
        (which includes loyalty and disdain towards certain groups). 
          
        This option is best used on Custom Followers provided and installed
        by other mods. Specifically mods where the follower comes with their
        own AI and doesn't use a follower slot.
          
        I do NOT recommend using this on BOS, Insititute or Railroad members
        as it can cause them to open fire on the NPCs around you when you 
        visit opposing group headquarters. (Unless you dont mind since you
        are siding heavily with a specific group anyway).
            
     4) Make Follower (Follow only. DO NOT MANAGE)
      
        This option places the NPC in one of your 5 follower slots, so that
        they will follow you around. You gain access to their inventory and
        a few basic commands like get behind me. But that is about the extent
        of it. This is the safest option for users that are paranoid that Aft
        might break one of their Custom Followers. I don't really recommend
        using this on non-custom followers.
      
     5) Make Settler

        Makes the NPC into a settler and prompts you for which settlement/city
        to assign them to. This was primarily added so that users could help 
        out those NPCs that they rescue or aid during the coarse of the game 
        than seem to have no place to go. 
                    
        There is no limit to how many settlers you can import nor are there 
        any race restrictions. However, imported settlers retain their Faction 
        loyalty, so if you force certain NPCs to the same settlement (Say 
        members of the railroad and insttitute), there may be internal 
        fighting.
          
        AFT's Settler system and AFT's Follower system are integrated together.
        If you assign a Managed Follower to a settlement, and the follower lacks
        the scripts needed to be a settler, AFT will automatically use its own 
        Settler management system. Conversly, if you UnManage a follower who 
        was assigned to a settlement, they may return to the settlement anyway
        as an AFT Settler. You will need to use the AFT Activator on them a
        second time and select "UnMake Settler" to end management.
          
          Known Issue: 
		  
            Fallout 4 doesn't completely recognize AFT settlers for the sake 
            of computing population. At times population will reflect a number
            that doesn't include AFT settlers (and sometimes it will. It is a 
            toss up). However, this appears to only affect population and not
            resources such as food, water or defense. 
          
     6) Ignore NPC

        This option makes AFT ignore the NPC completely. Using the AFT 
        Activator on them will go strait to all follower mode, as if they
        aren't even there. Should a conversation cause the game to make them 
        a companion, AFT will treat them like you imported them with the
        "DO NOT MANAGE" option above. 
          
        NOTE: Because AFT completely ignores the NPC, there is no way to
        undo this flag without using console commands or installing
        and reinstalling AFT.
             
  E. Global Settings

     Global settings are used for settings that affect all followers. It also 
     supports admin-like functions like prepping for uninstall.

     You can access Global settings in two ways. First, you can access them 
     via the Tools menu of the AFT Activator. This is recommended if you are
     using VR.
     
     The second Method is to use the AFT Settings holotape located in your
     Misc items. 
     
        ----------------------

        ----------------------
           
     1) Follower Limit
        
        The Follower limit indicates how many followers you may have in 
        addition to the dog. The default value is also the maximum. 3
        is recommended for slower hardware and game consoles.     
           
           ----------------------
           Global Follower Limit
           ----------------------
           > Limit : 1
           > Limit : 2
           > Limit : 3
           > Limit : 4
           > Limit : 5
           ----------------------
                     
        NOTES: 
          
          Follower Limit does not affect the maximum number of MANAGED NPCs, 
          which remains hard coded at 32. A Managed NPC is any NPC that you
          are enhancing with AFT (think outfits and combat settings). 
            
          Managed NPCs do not include NPCs who you turned into Settlers
          using AFT's Make Settler import command.

           [X] Limit Loot Comments
           [ ] Lock Comment Rotation to ...
           ----------------------
           
        DETAILS:
           
        a) [ ] Minimize Comment Overlap
           
           When you have multiple followers, sometimes they all try to say 
           something at the same time. So AFT includes commentary management to
           try and organized comments so that everyone speaks in turn. 
           
        b) [ ] Allow Multiple Interjections

           This setting allows AFT to monitor quest progress so that it can
           force all followers to comment during dialogs with interjection
           points.

           When AFT causes followers to speak, you can have the camera "break
           cinematic" mode and center on each speaker or you can leave the 
           camera in cinematic mode, but it will cause the camera to remain on
           the first speaker or the player.
           
           When Center camera on each speaker is checked, you can further
           have AFT attempt to pause the cut-scene so that spoken audio can
           have subtitles and the words will be spoken in the players head.

           Note the word "Attempt". This doesn't work on all cut-scenes and in
           testing seemed to only work on the spouse. It also allows the person
           you are talking to to continue walking around (IE: Preston). That is 
           why the option is disabled by default.  

        c) [ ] Limit Comments per Event
           
           This setting is used to cap how many comments are spoken when 
           commentary management is enabled to help commentary feel more
           natural. When toggled, you can limit the number of comments made
           per event from 1 to 4 comments (untoggle for the value 5). The
           Default value is 2.

           Notes: 
           
             The Commentary Manager randomly picks the followers that speak 
             comments so that the same companions are not always making all the 
             comments. 
           
           Explanation:
           
             When comments are managed, everyone speaks in turn, but this 
             causes a delay. For example, you step in a river and take 
             radiation damage. 20 seconds later, the river is nowhere in sight 
             but the 5th follower is just now starting to say their peace about
             the radiation. 
           
             In play testing we found that 2 comments felt natural, 3 comments 
             pushed the boundaries and at 4 or more comments and the commentary 
             started to feel awkward and unnatural.

        d) [ ] Limit Loot Comments

           Typically looting comments uses the SHORT cooldown timer, allowing
           your companions to comment on your looting habits as frequently as 
           once a minute. When you toggle LIMIT LOOT COMMENTS, it will cause  
           your companions to use the MEDIUM cooldown timer for loot events. 
           By default, the MEDIUM cooldown timer limits frequency to once 
           every 40 minutes.

           Some users will combine toggling this setting with decreasing the
           Medium cooldown to 20 or 10 minutes to try and strike a balance.

        e) [ ] Set Main Follower to ...
		   
           When disabled (default), AFT rotates the primary companion every 
           15 seconds so that the commentary is distributed among all followers.
           Who says what and shows up in cutscenes is effectively randomized.
    
           When enabled, sets the primary Follower to use for all cut-scenes
           and commentary. Enabling the option will bring up a list of Active
           Followers and the selected follower will remain the primary follower
           until dismissed or until the option is disabled.
        
     3) Global Combat Settings

           ----------------------
           Global Combat Settings
           ----------------------
           [ ] Ignore Murder
           [ ] Allow Followers to Heal Self
           [X] Allow Followers to Heal Others
           [X] Followers Catch up on Weapon Draw
           [ ] Followers Stealth when Sneaking
           [ ] Use Combat Outfit on Weapon Draw
           [ ] Scale Follower Damage
           ----------------------
             
        a) [ ] Ignore Murder
           
           Toggle this setting if you want companions to ignore Murder events. 
           
           Explanation:
           
             Murder occurs when the player kills someone who was not actively 
             hostile towards the player and was not the target of a current 
             mission/quest. Every one of the 13 original CORE companions hates
             murder and will voice disapproval and threaten to leave if the 
             player is directly responsible for the death of an innocent. 
           
             The most common "accidental" cause of murder is placing powerful 
             mines on the ground near or around settlements.
           
           NOTES:
           
           - This setting only protects the player from MANAGED NPCs. So for 
             example, if you kill a settlement NPC such as Marcy Long, nearby 
             Non-Managed settlers may still react and attack you. 
           
           - When you import an NPC into AFT, they are removed from all 
             factions. So, you can import an NPC (Such as Marcy Long) and then
             eliminate them without reactions or consequences.     
             
        b) [ ] Allow Followers to Heal Self
          
             When this option is enabled, any follower who possess a stimpak (repairkit
             for robots if DLC01 is installed) can heal themself when they enter 
             bleedout. Note that when you enable this option, the player loses the 
             oppoortunity of getting an affinity boost from healing companions themself. 

        c) [X] Allow Followers to Heal Others
          
             When this option is enabled, followers with stimpaks or repairskits will 
             run to each others aid when another follower falls into bleedout.  Note 
             that when you enable this option, the player may lose the oppoortunity of 
             getting an affinity boost from healing companions themself. 
                          
        d) [X] Followers Catch up on Weapon Draw
           
           When this box is checked, any Active followers who are not waiting
           and are further than 32 feet away from you will teleport behind you
           anytime you draw your weapon. 
           
           NOTES:
           
           - Followers will not teleport behind the player if they are actively 
             in combat. This allows the player to switch weapons during combat 
             without constantly interrupting follower combat. 
           
        e) [X] Followers Stealth when Sneaking
           
           When this box is checked, your followers will receive a stealth boy
           effect anytime you are sneaking to minimize their impact on your 
           visual stealth. 
           
           NOTES:
           
           - If any of your followers are using an AGGRESSIVE combat style (the
             default for several), they will attack enemies on sight and give
             away your stealth. If you are trying to play stealth, make sure 
             to set all Active Followers Combat Style to Defensive. 
           
           - The Stealth boy effect does not work on some races like Mr. Handy.

           - Stealth boys don't hide sound. For this reason, large parties 
             (more than dog and 2 NPCS) are almost always detected due to the 
             sound generated when moving.
             
             The recommended stealth approach for larger parties is to tell 
             followers to "hang out here", sneak into an enemy camp solo and then 
             summon them to your side once you are clear using the Summon All 
             Action. 
                
        f) [ ] Use Combat Outfit on Weapon Draw
           
             This option causes followers to equip their Combat Outfit 
             when you have your weapon drawn instead of waiting for 
             combat to begin. The Combat Outfit will remain on as
             long as your weapon is drawn. 

        g) [X] Scale Follower Damage  
               Incoming Damage [2.0]
               Outgoing Damage [0.5]
			   
             When this option is enabled, Aft scales all followers incoming and 
             outgoing damage by specified multipliers. This was added to help
             with game balance, especially on harder difficulties where vanilla
             bugs normally result in overpowered followers. 

             When enabled, recommended values will be set and used based on
             current difficulty level. However, users are free to modify these
             multipliers independently to make the game easier, harder or more
             balanced. 
		   
      4) Global Misc Settings
           
        An assortment of unrelated global settings that don't fall into a 
        single category:
                   
           ----------------------
           Global Misc Settings
           ----------------------
           [X] Info Reveals Synths
           [X] Treat Settlements as Cities
           [X] Add Progress to Affinity Feedback             
           [X] No Collision with Followers
           [X] Follower Flee in Workshop Mode
           [ ] Disable AutoRelax (Global Override)             
           [ ] All Followers ride Vertibird             
           [X] Restore AFT Items on Game Load
           [ ] Allow Core Companion Import
           [ ] Auto Assign Stats for Combat Styles
           [ ] Gather Loose Items: Remove Bodies
           ----------------------
           
        DETAILS:
           

             
        a) [X] Info Reveals Synths
           
           By default, AFT will reveal synths in the Traits tab when you Scan 
           NPCs. 
           
           Untoggle this setting to have AFT hide synths and display them as
           regular humans.

        b) Treat Settlements as Cities

           This option affects Outfit selection. City Outfit normally applies
           to trading hubs such as Bunker Hill, Diamond City, Covenant, Vault 81
           and GoodNeighbor. When this global toggle is checked, all player 
           settlements will also be treated as cities for the purpose of outfit
           enforcement. 
                        
        c) Add Progress to Affinity Feedback
           
           Adds [##/100] progress indicator to the end of like/love
           dislike/hate messages so you can keep tabs on follower
           relationship progress without having to use the INFO 
           menu on them constantly. Note that the game allows
           a buffer so that you can actually raise your companions
           score to 110/100. (So you dont loose their admiration
           just because you do 1 thing they dislike).          

        d) No Collision with Followers

           When you approach a follower, AFT disables their clipping at the
           moment you would normally bump into them. This allows you to walk
           through them.
		   
		   Notes: 
		   
		   - Followers animations become locked when clipping is disabled. If 
		     they are in motion, they will continue forward (possibly through 
			 walls) until they get some distance from you. If they were standing
			 still, they will be unable to move or talk until you back off a 
			 little bit. For this reason, AFT will not remove clipping if the
             follower is using furniture like a workbench, so that they can
             finish their animation and stop using the device.
			 
           - Not sure why, but No Collision doesn't work on Dogmeat. 
		   
        e) Follower Flee in Workshop Mode

           This option turns on an AI setting so that the follower flees 
           the player when in Workshop mode. Note that it can take up to 
           a minute for the AI to kick in. 

        f) Disable AutoRelax

           You can individually disable AutoRelax on followers, but often
           times you may want to just disable it on everyone at once. This
           setting disables autorelax for everyone at once.
           
        g) All Followers ride Vertibird

           By default, AFT will limit the number of followers who will ride
           the vertibird to 2 (and sometimes less). Toggle this option on
           to allow all followers to board. This typically results in 
           followers overlapping on certain seats, but it also means everyone
           gets out at the destination instead of the others teleporting
           to you to catch up. 

        h) Restore AFT Items on Game Load

           This option was added for users who configure FO4Hotkeys who may
           not need the AFT Activator to restore itself on game load if 
           it has been discarded (and assign itself to favorite slot #3). 

           Disable this option and AFT items will stop respawning. Untoggle
           at your own risk. 
             
        i) Allow Core Companion Import
           
           By default, AFT will prevent you from forcing core companions to
           follow you to prevent breaking the game. FOr example, if you force
           Piper to be a follower before getting into diamond city you may never
           get into diamond city.
           
           Toggle this setting if you wish to disable the safeties so you
           can force CORE companions to follow you. Use carefully as bad timing
           can break the game or certain quests/factions (as pointed out above).

        j) Auto Assign Stats for Combat Styles

           If this option is enabled, then you will be promoted if you wish to 
           automatically redistribute stats to match combat styles when you
           assign a combat style. When disabled, you will not be prompted and
           stats will not be automatically adjusted.

        k) Gather Loose Items: Remove Bodies
           
           Remove dead bodies after looting when using Gather Loose Items. 
		   
     5) Global Cooldown Settings

           ----------------------
           Cooldown Settings
           ----------------------
           Gen Events Long  [100 mins]
           Gen Events Med   [40 mins]
           Gen Events Short [1 min]
           Talk Idle Following [2-3 min]
           Talk Idle Dismissed [4-8 min]
           AutoRelax Delay [30 sec]
           ----------------------

        a) GEN EVENTS

           Some events have cooldowns to control how often they will happen. 

           Cooldowns control the frequency of reactions (both commentary
           and affinity changes) but not the event itself. The game can't 
           stop you from jumping into an irradiated river every minute, but
           it can ignore the event until a cooldown expires. 

               Below is a list of the events the game monitors and throws
               events for. If you change a cooldown, you cap the frequency
               that companions will react to all events associated with that
               cooldown:


               Immediate (No Cooldown)

               ChemAddiction

               ** : Loot events can be associated with the MEDIUM cooldown. 
                    See Limit Loot Comments toggle under Global Chat Settings.

        b) TALK IDLE COOLDOWNS

           These cooldowns affect Idle Commentary. Or at least that is what 
           they are supposed to do. They rarely work as expected.

           TALK IDLE FOLLOWING 

             Controls the games Idle Commentary cooldown when a companion
             is following you.  

           TALK IDLE DISMISSED

             Controls the games Idle Commentary cooldown when a companion
             has been dismissed. However, if you assign followers to a 
             settlement, the idle cooldown is ignored by the settlement AI. 
             If you assign followers to CAMP or their original home, the 
             setting works. However camp is a small enclosed space, so you 
             will still hear your followers speaking their HELLOS, GREETINGS 
             and PLAYER EVENT reactions like using a workbench. You wont get 
             the 15 min of silence you were expecting.

        c) AUTORELAX DELAY

           When auto-relax is enabled, this delay controls how long you 
           must/can linger before auto-relax kicks in.
                          
     6) View Readme
           
        Opens up the In-Game Readme. The In-Game readme is an abbreviated
        Basic version of this readme, with recommendations, special cases and 
        fine-grained details removed.
           
     7) Restore Aft Activator
        
        If you somehow misplace your AFT Activator, you can use this option
        to spawn a new one in your inventory. 
        
     8) Summon Everyone!
        
        This is a convenience command for summoning all managed NPCs. It is 
        provided to aid in uninstall. To prevent abuse of the command, it 
        can only be used 3 times in a single save and a week of game time
        must pass between each use. Then the command goes away.
          
     9) Prepare for Uninstall
        
        This option unmanages all of your NPCs, attempting to undo any
        changes AFT made to them. It also shuts down all AFT related 
        support quests and resets variables to pre-install values. 

        For example, your spouse will disappear if you rescued them. Your
        AFT Camp will go away. Appearance and wardrobe changes made to 
        companions will be undone to the maximum extent possible. Any 
        followers who were not UNIQUE NPCs will generally disappear. 

        Ideally once the method is complete, you would save and then go to 
        the main menu and disable the AFT MOD. The "[M]" will remain next to 
        the save, but the Uninstall ensures AFT gracefully released any 
        resources it was using. (So it shouldn't interfere with any other mods
        you may wish to install and try out).  

        Things that are NOT undone:

        - Settlement changes and purchases are not be undone. This includes the 
          Clearing of settlements and the purchase of any walls or prefabs. 

        - Any visual changes made using the SCULPT menu will persist. So if
          you used the Sculpt menu to change Pipers hair or give Preston a
          difference face, these changes will persist. 

        - Death is not undone. So if you used AFT to kill an essential NPC, 
          they will remain dead.

        - Custom Faction removals are not undone. AFT only knows about 
          vanilla factions, so if you Import (Full) a Mod Companion that
          has Mod-Specific factions, those factions are not recovered.
   
  F. AFT Camp
     
     Access AFT's mobile camp from the Actions menu by selecting "Setup Camp".
     
     Players start off with a simple fire pit (cooking Bench) and sleeping bag.
     AFT also adds a Map Marker so players can fast travel back to camp 
     when desired. (Camp can be used as an anchor to return to isolated
     locations). 
     
     The fire pit is persistent. This means if you tear down camp and rebuild
     it elsewhere, your stored items will still be present. 
     
     For many players, a basic portable container/sleeping bag/map marker is
     enough. For those who want more, AFT offers an optional expansion quest 
     that starts the first time you setup camp.   
          
     1) AFT Camp Expansion

        The quest involves gathering items and resources to upgrade camp.

        a) Find/Fix APC         (to justify mobility)

           Requires that you approach the APC marooned in the water near 
           sanctuary or pay someone else to do it for you (500 caps). There 
           is generally a low level creature protecting it (Blood bugs) and 
           Radiation because of nearby barrels. Enter the APC to complete 
           the quest.  

        b) Gather/Purchase wood (to build foundation)

           Requires either 200 wood or 600 caps. This is generally not 
           difficult if you use the settlement menu to clear/scrap 
           Sanctuary and then grab the wood from the workbench. Once you 
           have the materials, complete quest by going to the TOOLS menu on
           the Aft Activator. 
 
           After this quest is complete, you will get a wooden platform 
           with a terminal when you use the Setup Camp action. The Terminal
           allows you to purchase additional items for camp. 

        c) Locate mobile homes (to build Walls)
 
           Requires that you to travel to 4 specific locations that contain 
           mobile home units and enter the mobile home, or pay your followers
           to do it for you. (500 caps each location)
 
           After the Mobile Home quest, the AFT Camp Expansion Quest will 
           complete and disappear from your Tools menu. 
 
        d) Locate and fix UFO
 
           At some point in the game, you will likely witness a UFO crash
           in the distance (it crashes East of Oberton Station). When this 
           occurs, you will see a UFO Camp Expansion Quest show up on 
           the Camp Terminal. You can either hike out to the UFO and salvage
           it yourself or pay someone else to do it for you (10,000 caps)
 
           The UFO upgrade adds a radiation shield to your camp and provides
           an movable platform that can be reach high locations or snipe. 
  
     2) Camp Terminal
    
        To access the Camp Terminal, you must complete the first 2 phases of
        the AFT Camp Expansion Quest. Build camp with a foundation and the 
        terminal will appear: 

        ----------------------
        AFT Camp Control
        ----------------------
        > QUEST: Camp Expansion
        > Buildings
        > Amenities
        > Defenses
        > UFO
        > Settings
        ----------------------

        - The Quest menu only appears when Camp Expansion is active. 
        - The UFO menu only appears if you salvage a UFO

     3) Camp Terminal : Buildings
        
           ----------------------
           Buildings
           ----------------------
             [X] Foundation
               [X] Module 1
               [X] Module 2
               [X] Module 3
               [X] Module 4
           ----------------------
           
        Modules will appear as you complete portions of the Camp Expansion 
        quest. By default Modules are enabled, however you can disable
        modules if you prefer a more open camp. 
           
        Each module has a sliding door and light switch that lets you 
        customize the interior lighting of your camp. The first module 
        (Module 1) also includes a water fountain.
          
          You can also disable the Foundation. This causes camp items to 
          get placed with the lay of the land (as best as possible). As 
          the UI implies, Modules (and their light sources) will not appear
          if you disable the foundation. But all other items will still
          appear when foundation is disabled.

     4) Camp Terminal : Amenities
        
        Use this menu to purchase amenities or configure options on your
        purchases amenities.

           ----------------------
           
        DETAILS:
             
        a) Benches             
              
           Benches allow you to construct and maintain items. They can also be 
           used to store items you aren't currently using. AFT Camp includes 5 
           possible benches, each one is persistent. (Items remain even when 
           you teardown and reconstruct camp elsewhere). 
              
              ----------------------
              Benches

              ----------------------
              
           In the case of the cooking bench, you can elect to have a fire pit
           in the middle of camp or a stove along one of the walls. 

        b) Beds             

           Beds allow you to rest and heal. The Med Bay will also allow you to
           heal radiation damage, remove diseases and fix broken limbs. However
           the Med Bay is not available until you have encountered one in the 
           game. Hint: You have to join/visit one of two technologically 
           advanced factions to gain access to one.

           You may purchase up to two beds. Their placement within camp is 
           pre-determined.
              
        c) Seating             
              
           Seating provides a place for your followers to sit. Some seats
           such as the Leather Couch will also cause the follower to take
           on a more provocative pose when using it.

           Misc contains a number of interesting items that reflect the
           personality of the player. 

              ----------------------

              ----------------------

           NOTES:

           - The CryoPod is a Fridge that can be used to convert Nuka Colas 
             to Ice Cold Nuka Colas or convert them to Cryo Cell ammunition. 
             
           - The Bathroom includes a shower and toilet that followers will
             use. 

           - The Memory Lounger is fully function and allows the player 
             to revisit a memory of pre-war sanctuary.


     5) Camp Terminal : Defenses
           
           Any Defense purchase will places 8 turrets around the parameter of 
           Camp, insuring at least 2 turrets can fire at any approaching enemy 
           target (4 turrets can fire if the target approaches from a corner)

           All turrets look the same, though ammunition, fire rate and turret 
           Health differ based on Level. 

           ----------------------
           Defenses
           ----------------------
           > Turrets I   : 400 caps
           > Turrets II  : 800 caps
           > Turrets III : 1600 caps
           > Turrets IV  : 3200 caps
           ----------------------
        
        DETAILS:
           
        a) Turrets I
           
           "Turrets I" will appear as a purchase option if the player exceeds 
           level 5. Fires basic 5.56 rounds at a slow rate. 250 HP each. 
           
        b) Turrets II
           
           "Turrets II" will appear after the player exceeds level 15. Fires
           Armor Piercing 5.56 rounds at a higher rate. 500 HP each.
           
        c) Turrets III
           
           "Turrets III" will appear after the player exceeds level 27. Fires
           High energy blue laser blasts at a moderate rate. 750 HP each.
           
        d) Turrets IV
           
           "Turrets IV" will appear after the player exceeds level 39. Fires
           High energy blue laser blasts at very high rate. 1000 HP each.
           
        REPAIRING:

          To repair damaged turrets, disable the turrets from the camp console 
          and then re-enable. 

     6) Camp Terminal : UFO
          
           ----------------------
           UFO
           ----------------------
           > Set Color
           ^ Raise 500 ^
           V Lower 500 V
           Beam me up!
           Reset Height
           ----------------------
           
           Once salvaged, the UFO will hover above your camp, providing 
           protection from rain and radiation. The bottom of the UFO also
           Provides an additional lighting source. 
           
        DETAILS:
           
        a) Set Color
           
           Similar to the light switches found on other modules, Set Color 
           Allows you to select a color for the bottom of the UFO to create
           unified or themed lighting. A list of colors will appear.

        b) Raise 500
           
           By default, the UFO hovers just above camp.  You can raise it    
           Roughly 20 stories into the air from its original location. (The 
           higher camp is to begin with, the higher you can raise it). 
           
           Combined with the Beam Me Up! Ability, this can provide access to
           High areas previously not accessible. For example, collapsed
           Bridges.        
           
        c) Lower 500
           
           This can be used to lower a UFO that was previously raised. It can 
           not be used to lower the UFO below camp. 
           
        d) Beam me up!
           
           Using technology found in the UFO, the player and any active 
           followers are beamed up to the UFO. (As in standing on top of 
           it). To beam back down, open up the Map and fast travel to the AFT 
           Camp Map Marker.  (Or if you have PowerArmor on, just jump...)
           
           NOTE: Radiation protection is lost if UFO is more than 6 stories up. 

        e) Reset Height
           
           UFO is returned to its starting position (acting as a roof for camp)

     7) Camp Terminal : Settings

           ----------------------
           Settings
           ----------------------
           [ ] Teleport Player PA
           [ ] Lock Doors
           > Dock Camp
           > Camp workbenches to Settlement
           > Settlement workbenches to Camp
           ----------------------

        a) [ ] Teleport Player PA
           
           Uncheck this setting if you do not want the players PowerArmor
           teleported to Camp when you build camp 

        b) [ ] Lock Doors

           Toggle the doors as being locked or unlocked. If you somehow
           lock yourself out, you can teardown camp or teleport in using
           Fast Travel


        c) > Dock Camp

           This only appears if you setup Camp within the perimeter of
           a settlement. It creates an AFT Camp Dock where the current 
           camp is located. Once created, the command will change to 

           > UnDock Camp

           When you "setup camp" within the settlement perimeter, if an
           AFT Camp dock is detected, the camp will construct itself 
           there. This allows users to create designated areas within
           their settlement for AFT CAMP to appear. (You can decorate
           the area using the regular workbench edit system). 

           Select "UnDock" to remove the dock (or just remove the object
           using the workbench). 

        d) Camp workbenches to Settlement

           Only appears when you setup camp up within the boundaries of a 
           settlement. 

           Transfers the contents of the Camp workbenches to the Settlement
           workbench so that items are available to support construction.
 
        e) Settlement workbenches to Camp : 

           Only appears when you setup camp up within the boundaries of a 
           settlement. 

           Transfers the contents of the Settlement workbench to your camp
           workbenches. Items outside the local settlement will not be
           pulled (you may still see materials available after transfer due
           to a supply line link).
      
  G. Saving your Spouse
       
     To save your spouse, you need to locate Robot Curie in Vault81 and bring
     her to your spouse's cryopod before the power runs out. Power runs out no 
     later than the start of Chapter 2 and in some cases earlier. For best 
     results, proceed immediately to vault 81 (You can rescue the Minutemen on 
     the way, but I wouldn't do much more than that)
      
      If you are in a rush and don't mind cheating a bit, AFT also include a batch
      script which will complete most of the steps below for you (so that you can
      almost instantly gain Curie when you emerge from Vault 111).  See #5 below
      for usage instructions.
       
     1) Where is Vault 81?
       
        West (and slightly north) of Diamond CIty is a small pond. Vault 81
        Skirts the West side of that pond. Best direct route from Concord 
        is to follow the train tracks south. After you pass Oberland Station, 
        look for a wrecked train on the tracks.  When you get to the train, 
        start heading directly to Diamond City.  You should come across the 
        pond and Vault 81 along the way. 
       
     2) How do I get in?
       
        The easiest and fastest way is to use a charisma challenge and 
        convince the guard you are from another vault. (IE: Save before trying 
        to open the vault and keep reloading until you succeed). Failing that, 
        you have to locate 3 fusion cores to trade to get in, which is almost 
        impossible early in the game.
       
     3) I'm in, now what?
       
        You need to start the Quest "Hole in the Wall". To do this, you have to 
        do two things:
       
        A) Take the tour offered by Austin after you get off the elevator. At 
           the end of the tour, tell Erin you will find her cat Ashes.

        B) Go immediately to the Medical facility and talk to Dr. Forsythe.
           Agree to donate some blood. 
       
        C) Leave the Vault Retrieve Ashes the Cat. Don't talk to anyone. 
           
        D) When you return, Visit medical. You should see Bobby, Dr. Forsythe
           and Dr. Penske talking. Go listen in and accept their request to 
           Explore the hidden vault. 
 
           Common Problems : 
           
           Hole in the wall will start when you enter Vault 81 and all required 
           NPCs are available. IE: not being used by other quests. Hole in the 
           Wall Requires Austin, Dr. Penske, Dr. Forsythe, Bobby De Luca and 
           the Overseer. 

           If you talk to any Vault 81 residents and start quests that involve 
           these NPCs, Hole in the Wall gets delayed until those quests are 
           done. So for example, Talking to Tina Delucia can start the quest 
           Dependency, which uses Bobby Delucia. Talking to the School teacher 
           starts a quest that uses Austin. Talking to Dr. Penske can start a 
           quest that involves getting Fertilizer for her.  To start Hole in 
           the Wall as quickly as possible, avoid talking to anyone other than 
           Austin, Erin and Dr. Forsythe.
        
     4) Completing "Hole In the Wall"
    
        It should be noted that if a molerat manages to land a single bite on
        ANYONE, the player will contract the molerat disease. It doesn't matter
        if the NPC is human or robot. It doesn't even matter if they are in 
        your party (if a molerat bytes a patrol robot, you will also get the 
        disease). 

        About the only way to complete the quest without getting the molerat 
        disease is to play it solo. If you have a companion with you, tell 
        them to STAY after destroying the 3rd Ceiling Turret. Don't bother 
        using the terminal to activate the patrol robot. 

        My Advice: Jump on top of boxes and shoot the molerats from a high 
        location. Keep an eye on your status. If a "Q" suddenly shows up at 
        the bottom of your status window to "view effects", then you got the 
        disease. The mother is the hardest. They may be molerats, but you 
        generally aren't very high level at this point. I actually used the 
        Minigun to take out the mother. 

        Once you reach Curie, use Actions -> Summon Everyone to teleport your
        follower(s) back to you. 

        Back to the Medical Bay to deal with Austin. After that is done, Curie 
        will ask if she can accompany you. Say yes and then head back to 
        Sanctuary and Vault 111. Approach your spouses Cryo-Pod with Curie (and
        Codsworth if you wish) to begin the rescue scene.

     5) How to cheat and gain Curie Quickly:
      
         Open Console and type: bat unlockcurie
         Unpause console and wait for all the messages to finish displaying
         Open Console again and type:
          
            prid 102249
            moveto player
          
          Curie will appear, ready to join you. 
          
          SPECIAL NOTE : If you visit Vault 81 later in the game, the vault
          door will be closed. To open it, open console and click on the vault
          door with the mouse while the console is open. Then type the command:
          
            SendAnimEvent "Stage2"
          
          That will open the door. 
      
     6) Maximizing Spouse Interactions
        
        AFT reuses pre-existing audio to support spouse scenes. When it comes 
        time to play a scene, it checks to see if the required audio is 
        available and if so, the scene plays. If not, the scene is skipped.
        
        Some audio is only available in specific locations.  So if you wish 
        to ensure all scenes are played, you need to make sure you are in the
        correct area when specific affinity thresholds are reached:
        
        - 250 : This is the hardest scene to witness as the friendship scene
                requires audio that is only  available when standing in Finch
                Farm. If you wish to see the scene, I recommend heading to 
                Finch Farm immediately after rescuing your spouse. Once the 
                location is marked on your map, continue the game as normal, 
                knowing you can fast travel back quickly when your spouse 
                approaches 250.

                HINT: If you give your spouse the wedding ring, it will 
                      create a 40 point affinity boost. So wait until your
                      spouse is above 210 and then use the ring to boost
                      the affinity while at Finch's Farm. 
               
        - 500 : The admiration scene will always play, but it will skip some
                lines if you are not near or in Goodneighbor when it plays. 
                Recommendation: When your spouse gets to 425, head to 
                Diamond city and rescue Nick Valentine. That quest takes you to 
                Skinny Malones Base, which is near GoodNeighbor. 
                 
        - 750 : The confidant scene will always play, but it will skip some
                lines if you are not within range of WRVR. Fortunately, the 
                station has a large range covering most of the commonwealth. 
                The lines are rarely skipped unless you are under ground or
                in the far off reaches of the map (like The Glowing Sea).
                
        - 999 : The infatuation scene pulls from globally available lines. 
                This scene should work from anywhere in the game so long as 
                all 13 of the original core companions are still alive. If 
                any of the companions have passed away, some lines may not
                play.
                                 
  H. Creating Your Own Settlement Snapshots (Batch)
        
     1) Make sure your version of AFT support SnapShots

        If you do not see "> Save Prefab" under the Settlement menu, then go  
        and download Amazing Follower Tweaks from:
        
        https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/FalloutNexus.com 
        
        All versions uploaded to that site will include the Save Prefab ability.
        
     2) Enable Debug Logging
        
        a) Open the file :
        
           [My Documents]\My Games\Fallout 4\Fallout4Custom.ini
           
        b) Populate the Fallout4Custom.ini file with the following:
           
           [Papyrus]
           bEnableLogging=1
           bEnableTrace=1
           bLoadDebugInformation=1
           bEnableProfiling=1
           sDefaultLogOverlay=Papyrus
           
     3) Take Snapshot using Settlement Menu

        Stand in the Settlement you wish to take a snapshot of, 
        Activate AFT and go to the Tools -> Settlement Menu. 
        
        Select "> Save Prefab" and choose "Batch". 
        
        A file will be created under:
        
        [My Documents]\My Games\Fallout 4\Logs\Script\User\SETTLEMENTNAME.0.log
        
     4) Rename and move output file

        Rename file from ".0.log" and replace with ".txt"
        
        Move the file to the Fallout4 Data directory. Typically:
        
        [STEAMDIR]\steamapps\common\Fallout 4\data\SETTLEMENTNAME.txt
     
     5) Use console to load
   
        To load the settlement, make sure you are standing in the settlement
        Open console and type "bat [SETTLEMENTNAME]". For example, if you 
        take a snapshot of RedRocket, you would type "bat RedRocket"
        
        You can use the technique to move Settlements between save games or
        share the settlement with a friend who also has AFT installed. 

          See this video for a demonstration:
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCYX_mUH4bY&t=11s
          
        NOTE: If you are playing in Survival Mode, the console will not work
              without the aid of a console enabling mod.
                 
          If you wish to distribute your batch file to others without requiring
          them to use/install all of AFT, you can place a requirement on the
          mod: PrefabBatchLoader. This file includes a single, stand-alone, 
          non-conflicting script to support AFT Batch File expansion (for 
          PC users).

V. > > > > Hot Keys
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A. The Mod

     AFT currently supports Fo4HotKeys:

         https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11664/


  B. How To/Setup
     
     AFT includes console access to AFT Menu commands using the following
     format:

         cqf TweakPipboy ExeAFTMenuCommand ##COMMAND##

     Where ##COMMAND## is a number identifying the command. AFT created this
     access route specifically to support FO4Hotkeys, though other methods
     may be explored in the future.  

     FO4HotKeys supports console commands by assigning key combinations
     to items or console commands using the file:

         ../Fallout 4/Data/Hotkeys.ini

     NOTE: The default Hotkeys.ini binds the key "B" to Slot 3. However
     this conflicts with AFT's sculpt system and prevents users from editing
     body proportions. I suggestion editing the Hotkeys.ini file and removing
     the config for "B". 
     
     To make things easier, it supports MACROS. A macro is a small sequence
     of characters that gets expanded into a larger set of characters at runtime.

     So at the top of the Hotkeys.ini, I recommend creating the "aft" macro:

         [Macros]
         hot=cqf hotkeys activate
         aft=cqf TweakPipboy ExeAFTMenuCommand

     You can then assign aft # to any keys to activate AFT Menu commands. For
     example if you wanted:

         Shift + E = Activate AFT on NPC under target hair
         Shift + S = Setup Camp
         Shift + T = Teardown Camp
         Shift + 2 = Trade
         Shift + 3 = Relationship Info
         Shift + 4 = SPECIAL Editor

     You would use the Hotkeys:

         [Hotkeys]
         Shift-E=aft 0
         Shift-S=aft 7
         Shift-T=aft 8
         Shift-2=aft 27
         Shift-3=aft 61
         Shift-4=aft 123

     Notes:

     ** Brings up Pipboy (May have issues with mods that alter PipBoy)

     Be aware when using hotkeys, very few if any safeties are in place
     to prevent you from doing things that can mess up your game. Activate
     the appearance and/or settlement commands via hotkeys at your own 
     risk

     Global settings (AFT Settings Holotape) are not made available
     via hotkeys.

  D. Targeting Hotkeys
  
     AFT also includes a way to target a specific NPC with each hotkey
     command using the following syntax:

         cqf TweakPipboy ExeAFTMenuCommandOn ##COMMAND##  ##FOLLOWERSLOT##

     Where:

       ##COMMAND## is a number identifying the command and
       ##FOLLOWERSLOT## is a number identifying the SLOT of the follower

     The MANAGED SLOT is assigned when you recruit a follower and it will
     not change unless you unmanage them. They will keep their managed
     slot number even when dismissed.
     
     To find a followers slot number, use the INFO command on them and
     their managed slot will be displayed on the TRAITS tab. 
	 
     You can also use negative numbers to target the core companions that
     come with the original game:
	 
       -1 : Cait
       -2 : Codsworth
       -3 : Curie
       -4 : Danse
       -5 : Deacon
       -6 : Dogmeat
       -7 : John Hancock
       -8 : MacCready
       -9 : Nick Valentine
      -10 : Piper
      -11 : Preston
      -12 : Strong
      -13 : X6-88
      -14 : Ada
      -15 : Longfellow
      -16 : Porter Gage
      -17 : AFT Spouse
	 	 
         [Macros]
         afton=cqf TweakPipboy ExeAFTMenuCommandOn
  
         [Hotkeys]
         Shift-1=afton 131 -6
         Shift-2=afton 131 -1
         Shift-3=afton 131 -9
         Shift-4=afton 131 -17
         Shift-5=afton 131 -10
         Shift-6=afton 131 -3
		 
    NOTE: For safety reasons, Targeted NPCs must be close enough to the 
          player that their model is loaded in memory. If this is not
          the case, the targeted command will fail and act as if no one 
          was selected. Non-Targetted commands such as Summon All 
          Followers do not have this limitation.
	 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI. > > > >  Advanced Trouble Shooting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) Everything is Fuzzy

     When you raise the PipBoy, the world becomes fuzzy. If somehow you lower
     the pipboy and the game doesn't realize it, it can leave the world fuzzy. 
     Easiest fix is to look at your PipBoy again. When it lowers, it should
     solve the problem.

     Failing that, try getting into PowerArmor.

  2) PipBoy doesn't work

     This can happen if a MOD executes UNEQUIPALL on the player, leaving them
     without a pipboy. Unfortunately, this is hard to fix without the aid of
     a console. So if you do not have access to a console, your only option 
     is to reload a save where you still had a working Pipboy.

     If you have console, you can restore the Pipboy with the following 
     command:

        player.equipitem [TODO: Look up Pipboy code]

  3) A follower keeps walking away

     - Start by dismissing them and asking them to follow you again.
     - If that doesn't work, try UNMANAGING them and then re-import them. 
       (Or ask them to follow you if they are a CORE companion)
     - If that doesn't work, it could be a MOD conflict. Make sure AFT is at
       the bottom of your load order. 
     - If AFT is at the bottom of your load order, make sure there are no 
       .pex files in your Fallout 4/Data/Scripts directory. Some mods don't 
       properly use BSA archives. When a PEX file is in your Fallout 4
       directory, it can override any mods you have installed regardless of
       mod priority.	   

  4) AFT Activator acts like NPC is not under target hair when activated.
   
     As long as AFT Activator is working on SOMEONE, then it is safe to 
     say AFT is installed correctly. 
    
    In most cases, this behavior is by design. For example, if you are in 
     Combat and you try to to use AFT on a companion, it will act like they 
     are not there.  There are also cases of NPCs that are marked as 
     non-manageable by AFT because they are essential to the plot.
    
     Edge Cases include:
   
     - NPC is marked as Ghost. Activator wont work when IsGhost returns true.
       A vanilla bug would cause Followers to get marked as Ghost when exiting
       a vertibird. So use console to check the Ghost status.
   
    - If NPC is in a scene, AFT will not allow force import.
   
       This sometimes occures when meeting travelers who aren't moving or 
       are having a discussion.
   
     - If NPC is Red, then they are hostile. AFT will not allow force import.

  5) AFT does not initialize.

     The most common reason for this is a mod conflict over the Followers
     QUEST resource. If you are using aft with a previously modded save
     game and you had a different follower mod, it is possible that the
     required resources are still reserved by the other mod. 

     Best way to rule this out is place AFT at the bottom of your load
     order and start a new game. You should see AFT initialize within 
     20 seconds of exiting Vault 111 (after the prologue). 

  6) Game Crashes (When Loading a Prefab or some time afterwards)

     This happens when a mod such as AFT disables and/or deletes an 
     object within a settlement that a SETTLER is assigned to use. For
     example, if a settler is told to sleep in a specific bed and 
     AFT removes the bed. When the settler attempts to sleep
     (around 9 PM game time), the game may crash.

     The key here is how the settler gets assigned. If the game 
     assigns the settler automatically, then the game seems to be fine. It
     only crashes when users manually assign a settler to a job/bed using 
     the workshop menu and then the object is removed by a script.

     Crashing occurs when the settler attempts to use the deleted
     item. This may not happen immediately. For example, settlers
     don't attempt to sleep during the day. Furthermore, settlers
     remain dormant (doing nothing) when you are not actively near 
     the settlement. So days could pass with no crash and then one day
     you are near the buggy settler at the wrong time and boom.

     So if a crash occurs at what appears to be some random moment 
     when you are near a settlement, chances are a settler is just now 
     attempting to use an item you cleared when you ran "Clear Settlement" 
     or "Load Prefab".  

     How to fix: 

     a) One way is to go around and scrap all the assignable items 
        (beds, food, defense platforms, etc..). 

     b) An alternative to A (for evil characters) is to go around kill 
        everyone. Not an option at all settlements, but certainly for some. 

     c) A more fine grained approach is to use a settlement bell to summon
        everyone and then go around and see if you can figure out who is 
        still assigned to something. Typically when you hover over a settler
        it will say Assigned or Unassigned. If you are having crashing issues, 
        you know it is one of the assigned settlers. Try assigning them 
        to something else or killing them off.

    d) Remember, it is only an issue if you MANAULLY assign a task to 
       someone. Clear and Load Prefab are generally safe on newly 
       acquired Settlements, even ones that already have settlers.

VII. > > > >  Uninstall
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Open up your inventory and go to the MISC category. You should find a 
  Holotape labeled "AFT Settings". Use the holotape to bring up AFT Settings on
  your Pipboy. The Following menu should appear:
           
        ----------------------
        Global AFT Settings
        ----------------------
        > Follower Limit : 3
        > Global Combat Settings
        > Global Chat Settings
        > Global Misc Settings
        > Global Cooldown Settings
        > View Readme
        > Restore Aft Activator
          > Summon Everyone!
        > Prepare for Uninstall
        ----------------------

  Select the Final Entry "Prepare for Uninstall".

  A progress bar will appear. Once complete a message box will pop up with 
  instructions. They will tell you to exit the current game, Go to the MODS 
  menu and then disable "AmazingFollowerTweaks". Shut the game down and 
  restart once the mod is disabled (or deleted).
         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIII. > > > >  Technical (For developers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A. Making your custom NPC compatible with AFT

     Mod developers can use the following 2 unused vanilla factions to add 
     compatibility with AFT without needing to write Proxies, Softdependencies
     or create Hard-Dependency Addons:

     DanversFaction           0x0005A9AE
             
       This unused Vanilla Faction is used by AFT to flag NPCs that should not
       be managed by AFT. If SetFollower is called on an NPC who has this 
       faction (from say dialogue), AFT will only add a simple follow package
       and nothing else. 

     SalemFaction             0x0002C125
             
       This unused Vanilla Faction is used by AFT to flag NPCs that can be 
       managed by AFT, but should not have their factions altered in anyway. 
       AFT will allow AFT enhancements (outfits, combat style, idle chatter 
       settings, Level up support through SPECIAL stats, etc...) but will 
       not strip the NPC of factions. This allows mods an degree of control 
       over their follower.
         
       Note: AFT main quest runs with a priority of 91. So if you wish to take
             control of a follower, your Alias/AI will need to belong to a 
             quest with a priority of 92 or higher


  B. AFT as a Soft Dependency

     Developers wishing to make stand-alone mods will often create soft 
     Dependencies on other mods (or DLC). That is: They will check for them, 
     but they wont rely on them, simply disabling certain features if another 
     mod isn't present. 

     Soft dependencies are implemented using intermod communication methods. 
     For example, to retrieve the global variable TweakFollowerCount, from 
     AFT, you could do the following:

       String aftstr = "AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp" const
       GlobalVariable g
       g = Game.GetFormFromFile(0x01000FA2, aftstr) As GlobalVariable

     However, you don't want to retrieve the value all the time, because if a
     user does not have AFT, the call above will result in an error message
     getting logged to the log file. (Thus lots of calls could equal lots of 
     log spam and a performance hit). Even when logging is disabled, the method 
     above is expensive.

     1) Creating a Proxy

     The best way to implement a SOFT dependency on AFT is to create a proxy
     quest that checks for resources once and caches everything you need for 
     later access. Below is an example that exposes the number of followers and 
     the clear settlement function:

     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Quest  : AFTProxy
     Script : AFTProxyScript
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Scriptname AFTProxyScript extends Quest Conditional

     String aftstr = "AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp" const

     Bool Property Installed Auto Conditional

     ; List of properties you would like to expose...
     GlobalVariable Property TFCount Auto ; Shorthand for TweakFollowerCount
     Quest Property TweakScrapper Auto    ; Shorthand for TweakScrapScanMaster
     
     ; Support
     int NO_LOAD_FLOOD = 200 const
     int NO_LOAD_RETRY = 300 const

     Event OnQuestInit()
       Actor player = Game.GetPlayer()
       RegisterForRemoteEvent(player,"OnPlayerLoadGame")
       StartTimer(0.0, NO_LOAD_FLOOD)
     EndEvent

     Event Actor.OnPlayerLoadGame(Actor akSender)
       Actor player = Game.GetPlayer()
       UnRegisterForRemoteEvent(player,"OnPlayerLoadGame")
       RegisterForRemoteEvent(player,"OnPlayerLoadGame")
       StartTimer(0.5, NO_LOAD_FLOOD)
     EndEvent

     int attempts
     Event OnTimer(int timerID)
       CancelTimer(timerID)
       if (NO_LOAD_FLOOD == timerID)
         attempts = 0
         LoadAFTProxy()
         return             
       endif
       if (NO_LOAD_RETRY == timerID && attempts < 3)
         attempts += 1
         LoadAFTProxy()             
         return
       endif
     EndEvent

     Function LoadAFTProxy()
       if Game.IsPluginInstalled(aftstr)
         
         ; Sometimes there are timing issues. Retry up to 3 times
         
         Bool issue = false
         ; Load Resources
         TweakScrapper = Game.GetFormFromFile(0x0100919A, aftstr) As Quest
         TFCount = Game.GetFormFromFile(0x01000FA2, aftstr) As GlobalVariable
         
         if (!TweakFollowerCount || !TFCount)
           StartTimer(4.0, NO_LOAD_RETRY)
           Installed = false
         else
           Installed = true
         endif
       else
         Installed = false
       endif
     EndFunction

     Function AFTClearSettlement()
        if !Installed
          return
        endif
        ScriptObject s = TweakScrapper.CastAs("AFT:TweakScrapScanMasterScript")
        if s
           s.CallFunctionNoWait("clearSettlement", new Var[0])
        endif
     EndFunction
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
             
             
        The key with the proxy above is that it does all the work once when 
        someone starts a new game or loads a save. You can then use the proxy 
        within your source code and even conditions within CK Elements (Using
        GetVMQuestVar). 

          [TODO: Show Usage Example of Above Proxy]

              
     2) Resources
             
        Example Resources you can add/access/control in the proxy above: 
        This is not comprehensive. Just the most significant entry points:
             
        a) Quests
                          
           TweakPipBoy              0x01000FA2
             
             Hosts AFT:TweakPipBoyScript, which deals will relaying commands
             issued from the PipBoy to the proper areas of the mod. In some 
             simple cases (toggling a globalvariable for example), the PipBoy
             script functions handle the actions locally.
             
             This quest + script + function can be used to access most the 
             functionality in AFT as the Pipboy is the primary interface.
             The only reason to side-step the PipBoy is if you wanted to avoid
             PipBoy use. (Many functions will re-raise the Pipboy up).
             
           TweakFollower            0x01000FA2
             
             Hosts reference aliases that store state information for all the 
             NPCs managed by AFT. (Pose, outfit, etc..). Also hosts 
             TweakFollowerScript, which is the destination of most PipBoy
             commands (GUI aspect removed). 
             
        b) Factions
             
           Most AFT enhancements are enforced through faction membership
                          
           TweakAllowFriendlyFire   0x01065CA4
             
             NPCs added to this faction will react to friendly fire
             
           TweakConvNegToPos        0x01041598
             
             NPCs added to this faction will convert any negative reactions
             to positive reactions
             
           TweakConvPosToNeg        0x01041599
             
             NPCs added to this faction will convert any positive reactions
             to negative reactions
             
           TweakSyncPAFaction       0x0103FEBD
             
             NPCs added to this faction will Sync PA use with the player
             
           TweakNoDisapprove        0x0103FEBC
             
             NPCs added to this faction will never disapprove of player actions. 
             
           TweakNoApprove           0x01041592
             
             NPCs added to this faction will never approve of player actions. 
             
           TweakPackMuleFaction     0x0106550A
             
             NPCs added to this faction will get a 2000 pound carry boost.
             
           TweakReadyWeaponFaction  0x0106643E
             
             NPCs in this faction ready their weapon when the player does. 
             NPCs not in this faction wait until combat begins.
             
           TweakFollowerFaction     0x01000F9B
             
             All Managed Followers are a member of the this faction. Their RANK
             within the faction is their ID. Each ID corresponds with a 
             Reference Alias on the TweakFollower Quest which has scripts 
             attached that store information about the NPC (Like their Original
             Race, Home, etc...)
             
           TweakNamesFaction        0x01002E16
             
             This faction indicates the Follower name. The RANK equates to
             a name value. This only affects the name that appears in the
             PipBoy. Below is a list of the default names that come with AFT.
             Names mapping to values 51+ may be different depending on the ADDON
             the user has installed.

  C. AFT as a Hard Dependency

     Many mod authors will create compatibility patches with other mods by 
     creating a mod with Hard dependencies on both mods that makes the edits
     necessary to make them play well together. 

     This is done by renaming AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp and the authors 
     Mod.esp to ".esm" files. Then loading both ESM files in the creation
     kit, creating the changes needed and saving as a new AFT_SOMEMOD_PATH.esp. 

     The final step is editing the AFT_SOMEMOD_PATH.esp with FO4Edit and 
     changing the .esm parents to .esp parents (since in reality, the mods
     will be esps).

     This works well, especially for modders who are not comfortable with 
     scripting. However it has a distinct drawback. The patch is married to
     the versions of the hard-dependencies. So if either mod releases a new
     version, the patch may no longer work. 


  D. AFT Mandatory Resources (And potential areas of conflict)
           
     AFT avoids using original game resources, but there are cases where AFT
     had to because of tight integration with the original game.
           
     1) Quests: 
           
        a) Followers
           
           One of the few and only resources AFT must have to function. If it 
           is unable to obtain this quest because of another higher-priority 
           mod, AFT will not work.
           
           Not only does it make changes to the Follower Script (encapsulated 
           by a new state), but it also injects new aliases which are linked to
           by other quests. 
           
     2) Scripts
           
         a) followerscript.pex
            
            Attached to the Followers Quest, it redirects game core 
            functionality to use AFT. If this script is being overridden by
            a local file, AFT will not work.

  E. AFT Optionally Required Resources (And potential areas of conflict). 
           
     1) Quests

        a) DialogueCodesworthPostWar
           
           AFT makes some changes to this quests scene conditions so that it 
           uses the SPEAKER instead of the PLAYER. This allows codsworth to 
           speak gender appropriate comments to your spouse if the spouse is 
           rescued. If AFT doesn't get this resource, Codsworth may refer to 
           the SPOUSE using the wrong gender. (Not game breaking)
           
        b) DogmeatQuest
           
          AFT changes dogmeats alias flags so that Dogmeats name isn't 
          reserved and can be changed. Without AFT, dogmeats name is "Dog" 
          unless you learn his name from Mama Murphey in Concord. AFT changes
          it so that Dogmeats name is Dogmeat from the beginning but can be
          changed using AFTs naming system. If AFT doesn't get this quest, 
          you can't rename Dogmeat.
        
     2) Locations
        
        a) Commonwealth Location Wilderness, Coordinates (95,80)
        
          AFT places ObjectReference instances in this cell for items that 
          can not be created or changed using scripts. Most notably, this is
          where AFT stores the AFT CAMP Map marker. It also stores various
          objectreferences that use scripts like the CIS_EnterNewLocation 
          Script to hint to the CK that the mod needs the CIS_EnterNewLocation
          pex file.   
          
     3) Scripts 
        
          In some cases, AFT simply includes .pex files to override original 
          Game scripts. This works as long as changes do not introduce new 
          Properties or parameters (and no other mod provides the same script). 
          In the case of contention, the mod with the higher priority (bottom 
          of the mod list) wins.
              
          a)  CIS_EnterNewLocationTrigger.pex
              
              Provides support for Commentary Management
              
          b)  TrapBarnacle.pex
                   
              Provides support for trap avoidance
                   
          c)  TrapBase.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
              
          d)  TrapBreakableWalkway.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
              
          e)  TrapCanChimes.pex

IX. > > > >  Creating Your Own AFT Prefab option (Papyrus)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          
  The settlement prefab system was intentionally designed to be easily expanded
  using Add-On Mods.
          
  An Addon mod is a mod that requires AFT to be installed, but extends AFT so 
  that your settlement appears when users browse PreFabs available at a 
  specific location. This way, you don't have to convince the developer of AFT 
  to include your settlement, you just make your own settlement and put it out 
  there.

  You can even create Prefabs for DLC or MOD based Settlements (as long as the
  mod properly registers the Settlement with the WorkshopParent).

  (Optional) : These instructions require the use of the CreationKit. If you 
  would like to setup a better editor/compiler for the papyrus scripts, see 
  the developer setup instructions here: 

      https://github.com/Dheuster/AFT-FO4Edition/wiki/Developer-Setup
         
  A. Prefab Components:
          
     To build a Prefab Mod Extension, you need to create 3 things in the CK:
          
     - A Furniture with TweakPrefabOption and TweakBuilder scripts attached
         
     - A Quest with the script TweakRegisterPrefab attached as well as a
       Script with the output from "Save prefab -> Payprus" attached.
                    
     - A Terminal based on the AFT Template "TweakPrefabTerminalTemplate" that 
       identifies the Name and Author of the Prefab.
          
  B. Step By Step
          
     For this example, replace [AuthorName] with your handle. IE: the name you 
     go by on NexusMods or Bethesda.Net. Replace [PrefabName] with the name of 
     Settlement Prefab. Every Prefab needs a unique name + Author so people
     know what they are choosing (and to avoid conflicts). 
           
     So before you begin, decide on a name for your Prefab and which handle you
     will use. 
           
     1) If you haven't already downloaded it, get Creation Kit. Here is a
        starter link I wrote for beginners:
          
        https://www.creationkit.com/fallout4/index.php?title=Hello_World
          
     2) Go to your Fallout 4 Data directory and rename AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp
        to AmazingFollowerTweaks.esm

     3) Load Fallout 4 and AmazingFollowerTweaks resources:
          
        - Start Creation Kit
        - File => Data... => Check Fallout 4.esm and AmazingFollowerTweaks.esm
        - Hit [OK]
          
     4) Set Compile options for release-final
          
        - File => Preferences
        - Scroll Right and select the "Scripts" Tab
        - Select "Release Final" as compile option
        - Hit [Apply]
          
     5) Create a Terminal
          
        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Scroll down to the
          WorldObjects -> Terminal section and hi-light it. 
          
        - Enter "TweakPrefabTerminalTemplate" in the Filter box at the top of 
          the Left Pane.
 
        - Find the Terminal in the Right Pane and Double click on it to open.
        - Change the ID of the Terminal : 
          
            ID: [AuthorName][PrefabName]Terminal
          
        - Hit [OK] and select yes when prompted if you want to make a new Form. 
          (Don't do anything else yet)
          
     6) Update Terminal
          
        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Put your [AuthorName] in 
          the filter at the top of the pane. Dbl Click your new Terminal in the
          right pane: ( [AuthorName][PrefabName]Terminal )
          
        - Click on the Item Text entry. Change [PREFAB] - [AUTHOR] To reflect
          your prefab name and author info.
          
        - Change the $$$ in the entries to reflect the cost. 
          
          - I normally add all the component counts from my save output and 
            Round to the nearest multiple of 25. That becomes my cost.  But 
            you can do whatever you want. Whatever you use, you may want to
            write it down as you will need the numbers again soon.
          
        - Hit OK to save the changes and then Re-Open the Terminal.
          
        - Highlight LoadFull (...) and in the script window, Hit Properties
          Type : Quest
          Name : pTweakPipBoy
          
          When you hit Okay, it should auto-fill
          
          Hit [OK] Again to Return to the Terminal Details screen.
          
        - Select "Load Full ($$$)" option
          In the papyrus fragment, paste the following (without the
          hyphen lines:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
AFT:TweakPipBoyScript PipBoyScript = pTweakPipBoy as AFT:TweakPipBoyScript
if PipBoyScript
    PipBoyScript.BuildFullPrefab()
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
          
        - Select "The Load Wall Only ($$$)" option
          In the papyrus fragment, paste the following (without the
          hyphen lines:
          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
AFT:TweakPipBoyScript PipBoyScript = pTweakPipBoy as AFT:TweakPipBoyScript
if PipBoyScript
    PipBoyScript.BuildWallOnlyPrefab()
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
          
        - Select "Next" option
          In the papyrus fragment, paste the following:
          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
AFT:TweakPipBoyScript PipBoyScript = pTweakPipBoy as AFT:TweakPipBoyScript
if PipBoyScript
    PipBoyScript.NextPrefab()
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
          
        - Select "Previous" option
          In the papyrus fragment, paste the following:
          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
AFT:TweakPipBoyScript PipBoyScript = pTweakPipBoy as AFT:TweakPipBoyScript
if PipBoyScript
    PipBoyScript.PrevPrefab()
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          

        - Hit [OK]. It may take a while as it has to compile the scripts          

     7) Create Furniture (Stub)

        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Scroll down to 
          WorldObjects -> Furniture and hi-light Furniture.

        - In the Filter Box at the top of the left pane, enter 
          "InvisibleGeneric01"

        - Open up the Furniture and Rename it to reflect your Mod
          
          ID: [AuthorName][PrefabName]Furn

        - Hit [OK], (Twice to confirm you want to make a new ID).


     8) Create a Quest

        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Scroll down to 
          Character -> Quest and hi-light Quest

        - Within the right pane of the Object Window, Right-Click the 
          Background and select "New"

        - ID : [AuthorName]PrefabsQuest
          - Notice we didn't put the Prefab Name in the Quest. That is because 
            you can use 1 quest to manage all your prefabs.
          - Leave "Start Game Enabled" and "Run Once" checked. 

        - Hit [OK] 


     9) Update Quest

        - Double Click the Quest you just created. (You may have to filter for 
          your [AuthorName]) Opening it up a second time should reveal the 
          Scripts Tab.

        - Click on the "Scripts" Tab, then Click [Add]

        - Look for the existing Script "TweakRegisterPrefabScript"

        - The Properties Window should appear. Double Click the "Prefabs"
          Property and then Click Add. You will see three entries appear: 

            PrefabFurniture : Fill with [AuthorName][PrefabName]Furn
            PrefabLocation  : Fill with the Location of a Vanilla Settlement
            MaskedPrefabLocation : Fill with FORMID of DLC settlement mod 0x01000000
               
               ** You will only fill in Prefab location OR MaskedPrefabLocation. Not both.

              ** If it is a DLC, use special negative values:
                 
                   FarHarbor - Longfellows Cabin : -50464329 
                   FarHarbor - NationalPark      : -50369363
                   FarHarbor - EchoLake          : -50393345
                   FarHarbor - DaltonFarm        : -50564782
                       
              ** Value for Farharbor is based on FormID of original location
                 masked against a forced resid of -03.  ie: EchoLake normally
                 has formid (0x0100F101). Here that maps to (-0x0300F101), 
                 which is -50393345 in decimal.

              ** Settlements provided by mods are supported (Batch transfer
                    is fine), but generally will not work on different machines
                     as the resource ID of the mod location will vary based on 
                     load order. 
                                          
        - Click OK (twice) until you are back at the scripts tab. 

          NOTES: You can use this single script to Register multiple Prefabs by
                 adding additional furnitures to the Prefabs list.

        - From the "Scripts" Tab, Click [Add] => "[New Script]"

        - Name your script: [AuthorName][PrefabName]Script. Make sure to 
          Check the [X] Const option. 

        - Open up the script. This is where you paste the papyrus output 
          That was saved to the LogFile during Save Prefab:

          ** The Creation Kit default editor can't handle large scripts. 
             It will OPEN them and COMPILE them, but wont allow you to 
             Edit them after they exceed a certain size. A paste into the
             CK editor will likely fail and get truncated. 

             Most users will have to open and edit their script using The 
             "Open with External Editor" option in order to paste in the 
             large BuildFull() method(s).  

(Below is an example of what it might look like)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
ScriptName Example Extends Quest Const

Function BuildFull(TweakBuilderScript tbs, int clearFirst = 1, int 
requireNoFood = 1)
    ; requires [401] of [731A4] (471460)
    ; requires [653] of [731A3] (471459)
    if !tbs
        return
    endif
    ...
    ... ; MANY LINES LATER
    rbuild(123,4.5,6.7,8.9,0.0,0.0,0.0)
EndFunction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          

          If you saved off a Wall-Only export, you will need to rename the 
          "BuildFull" function to "BuildWallOnly" and also change the
          default for "clearFirst" and "requireNoFood" to be 0 and paste
          the edited function below the BuildFull() version. You also 
            want to add a skip_powerup() option. IE:

        - Finally, you need to compile the script. Do this by opening the 
          script with the CK's default editor. Go to the File menu of the 
          Editor and Select compile.
            
            ** NOTE: Compile Debug will generally work. But Compile Release
            will sometimes complain about an unrecognized 9th or 10th paramater. 
            Turns out that Papyrus can't can't handle small negative numbers 
            when optimizations are turned on. You can fix by searching for 
            the following values and replacing with suggested value:
            
            -0.000020  ->  -0.000021
            -0.000010  ->  -0.000011
            -0.000009  ->  -0.000011
            -0.000008  ->  -0.000011
            -0.000007  ->  -0.000011
            -0.000006  ->  -0.000011
            -0.000005  ->  0.000000
            -0.000004  ->  0.000000
            -0.000003  ->  0.000000
            -0.000002  ->  0.000000
            -0.000001  ->  0.000000

    10) Update Furniture

        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Scroll down to 
          WorldObjects -> Furniture and hi-light Furniture.

        - In the Filter Window, enter "[AuthorName]"

        - Open up Your Furniture ([AuthorName][PrefabName]Furn)

        - In the Scripts Area, Click Add.
   
          Attach the script TweakBuilderScript

        - In the Scripts Area, Click Add (again).

          Attach the script TweakPrefabOption

        - Dbl Click TweakPrefabOption to Open up its properties

        - Fill out the Properties:

          - PrefabTerminal   : Point at [AuthorName][PrefabName]Terminal
          - PrefabQuest      : Point at [AuthorName]PrefabsQuest
          - PrefabLoadScript : Enter "[AuthorName][PrefabName]Script" 
                               (without the dbl quotes)

            ** If you have namespace prefixes enabled, don't forget to 
               prepend them to the script name: 

               "[Prefix]:[AuthorName][PrefabName]Script"

               When in doubt, re-open the [AuthorName][PrefabName]Script under 
               the quest tab and note the name at the top. This is what should 
               go here.

          - PrefabPriceFull  : Price of Full Prefab (From Terminal)
          - PrefabPriceWall  : Price of Wall-Only Prefab (From Terminal)

          - Only Enable PrefabHasWallOption if you manually added a 
            BuildWallOnly() Function to the LoadScript.

          - By Default, Walls will not clear a settlement but Full Prefabs
            will. You can override this, though it is not recommended.

        - Once you finish filling out the Setup and Options Properties, 
          hit [Auto-Fill All] to fill in the Auto_Fill_All properties.

        - Hit [OK] to save Properties. And then [OK] on the Furniture.

  C. Save and Name Your Mod

     When you select save, you will be prompted for a name. After
     you save, go to the Data Menu and highlight your file. Fill 
     in the author and mod description info on the right. When you
     close the window, it will save again.

     Then exit Creation Kit.

  D. Fix AFT Master

     This step requires the use of FO4EDit:

     https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/?

     Run the program and select your ESP. Then expand your
     Mod and click on "File Header"

     There will be a tree breakdown of your Master Files. The first 
     entry will be Fallout4.esm and the second entry will be
     AmazingFollowerTweaks.esm. Change the name of AmazingFollowerTweaks.esm
     to AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp (Hit yes on the giant warning).

     When you exit FO4Edit, it will save your changes. Once the 
     changes are saved, rename the file AmazingFollowerTweaks.esm
     under Data back to AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp

  E. Test

     Start up a game and enable your mod. (possibly the game you 
     used to create it). Then Clear the Settlement and go to Load 
     Prefab. Confirm your mod appears as an option and builds 
     properly.

  F. Package

     Restart Creation Kit. Check Fallout 4.esm, AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp
     and Highlight your mod and hit the "Set Active" button. 

     Once loaded, select Data -> Create Archive, Hit Pack

     You will be prompted for at least 1 Filename, possibly 2. 

     You always name the first filename "[YOURMODNAME] - Main.ba2". 
     If the archive doesn't end with "- Main", it will be ignored.

     If you are prompted for a second filename, use the name:
     "[YOURMODNAME] - Textures.ba2" However this probably wont happen.

  G. Test Again

     To Properly test, Move any associated PEX files found under

         [FALLOUT 4]/Data/Scripts

     to a backup location outside the Fallout 4 directory. You created
     the scripts, so you should recognize the files that need to be
     removed.


     Then test again with your new ba2 archive and ensure your 
     settlement still works without those local pex files. Basically
     we are testing the archive to make sure it actually has everything
     you need. 

  H. Live Long and Prosper..... and Share...

     To upload to NexusMods, you create a directory and under the directory
     create a Data directory. And under that directory add the .esp and .ba2
     files. IE: 

     /myworkspace/data/joe_cool_prefab.esp
     /myworkspace/data/joe_cool_prefab - Main.ba2
     /myworkspace/readme_joe_cool_prefab.txt

     THen go to the parent directory (myworkspace above), hi-light 
     data (and optionally a readme) select Add to archive (I use 7zip). 
     Give the archive a name. 

     THe 7zip archive is what you upload to nexus. 

     Eventually I will update this to tell you how to upload to     
     Bethesda.net, XBONE and PS4... once I actually do it myself. 

     Don't forget to take some pictures and upload them to 
     AFTS Mod Page:

        https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26976/?

     And possibly post a link to the AFT Settlements forum:

        https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26976/?tab=5

  I. How do Addons Work Anyway? (For developers)
          
     Papyrus allows you to attach a "pointer" to something using a specific 
     name. For example, the game tracks the players PowerArmor by using the
     pointer name "LinkedArmor". 
          
        Player === (LinkedArmor) ===> [PowerArmor]
          
     These pointers are called LinkedRefs. You can't use just any old string
     name. You have to register the string name as a keyword. So to get the 
     players PowerArmor you would use:
          
       Keyword LinkedArmor = Game.GetForm(...) as Keyword
       ObjectReference PowerArmor = Game.GetPlayer().GetLinkedRef(LinkedArmor)
          
     In this case, the pointer goes from the player to the PowerArmor. It can 
     also go the other way. In fact, a large number of objects can point to the
     player using the same LinkedRef Keyword name:
          
       [PowerArmorA] === (LinkedArmor) ===> [Player]
       [PowerArmorB] === (LinkedArmor) ===> [Player]
       [PowerArmorC] === (LinkedArmor) ===> [Player]
          
     If we want to get all the PowerArmors that point at the player,we can use:
          
       ObjectReference[] PAs = Game.GetPlayer().GetRefsLinkedToMe(LinkedArmor)
          
     And this is the Basis for Addons. AFT looks for any Objects Pointing at a 
     Workbench that use AFT's prefab keyword "TweakPrefab":
       
       [AronsAwesomePrefab] === (TweakPrefab) ===> [RedRocket Workbench]
       [PattiesPinkPrefab]  === (TweakPrefab) ===> [RedRocket Workbench]
       [NormsNominalPrefab] === (TweakPrefab) ===> [RedRocket Workbench]
     
     AFT then exposes the objects via AFT's PipBoy... assuming the objects 
     properly cast to AFT's TweakPrefabOption interface.

     These objects can be installed/instantiated by anyone. Which means a mod 
     can be installed after AFT that adds a new object/prefab to the game 
     world that AFT will recognize.
