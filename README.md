I. > > > > Feature List:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          
  1) Multiple Follower support
       
     Allows dogmeat + (up to) 5 additional followers. 
       
  2) Appearance Sculpting
       
     Change the appearance of human and Ghoul followers using the same 
     sculpting system used to create the player. 
       
     Includes additional custom appearance editing tools that let you  
     scale followers size, change race, eyes or add gender agnostic hair. 
       
  3) Commentary Controls
       
     Manage commentary. Filter out negative/positive comments and prevent 
     followers from all blurting out their comments at once. 
       
  4) Personality reshaping
       
     Disable or even flip follower likes and dislikes.
       
  5) Follower Outfits
       
     Create up to 4 outfits: A standard outfit, a combat outfit, a 
     city outfit, and a camp outfit. They will automatically change as needed. 
       
  6) Gear Management
       
     Tell followers to remove all your junk, then have them convert all that 
     junk to scrap or caps. Then with a single command tell them to give you 
     everything they aren't using. (Transfers everything not assigned to an 
     outfit). 
       
  7) Follower Locator
       
     Includes "Locate Follower" function to select any NPC that AFT manages
     and have AFT guide you to them with a quest objective locator. 
       
  8) Pose Followers
         
     POSE non-active followers in an assortment of animations from dancing to 
     praying to add ambience to your camp or settlement.
         
  9) Camp Support
         
     Includes mobile camp that can act as travelling home-base. An excellent 
     feature for people who like to avoid fast travel and embrace a more 
     immersive play style. AFT Camp includes script-backed furniture that 
     goes beyond the capabilities of normal settlements. For example, a 
     memory lounger that will take you back to the pre-war world. 
         
  10) AI Tweaks
         
      Notable improvements include combat toggling of helmets (So you 
      can see the faces of followers wearing PowerArmor).  The ability for 
      followers to ignore traps and minor tweaks such as preferred follower
      distance and aggression.
         
  11) NPC Info
         
      View detailed information about your followers including attributes,  
      traits, perks, factions, race, home as well as personality traits
      (reactions) and relationship info for those NPCs that support it. 
         
      NOTE : This feature can also be used from the IMPORT menu on any
             non-hostile NPC for pre-import evaluation.
         
      By Default, Info reveals synths. This can be disabled if you desire.
         
  12) Tweak Settings (all are optional)
         
      - Home Assignment : Tell a follower to hang out at AFT Camp, go to a
        Settlement or go back to their original home. You can also tell them
        To make your current location their home.
         
      - Follower Mortality : Optionally make followers mortal.
         
      - Catch-up on Weapon draw : Have followers teleport to your side anytime
        you draw your weapon.
         
      - Enter/Exit PowerArmor with Player : Followers synchronize usage of
        assigned PA with the player. 
　
      - Sync Weapon Draw
　
      - Infinite Ammo - Follower wont use ammo
 
      - No PA Damage - Follower Power Armor takes no damage
　
      - Track Kills - Track Follower Kills.
   
      - Pack Mule : A convenience setting to increase Follower base carry 
        capacity to 2000.
         
      - Ignore Friendly Fire : In Fallout 4, by default Companions ignore
        friendly fire. This setting allows you to turn that off if you 
        wish for more realistic responses to being shot.
         
  13) Clear Settlement
         
      The worst thing about starting a new game is getting to a settlement and
      realizing you need to spend 20 minutes re-scrapping everything. Now you
      can just tell your followers to do it for you with a single command and 
      be done in seconds.
         
  14) Followers Build Prefab Settlements
         
      For a price, you can also tell your follower to build the settlement for 
      you. Prefabs include options for building a parameter fence only and 
      options to build the entire settlement. Sanctuary is Free. The others 
      will cost you.
         
               
  15) Additional Outfits for Nick
         
      With all the Gen2 body parts laying about, ever wonder why Nick doesn't 
      just grab some space parts and fix himself up? AFT adds some Nick-
      compatible outfits incase you want to change his look and fix his 
      hand in the process. 
         
  16) Save your Spouse
         
      Your spouse was shot in the head, but then immediately frozen. If you
      visit your spouse with Curie before the power in Vault 111 runs out (at
      the end of Act I hint, hint), you can save them.
         
      See below for more details on what to expect. 
         
  17) Settlement Export/Import: (PC Only)
         
      Export a settlement snapshot as a batch file and share it with others or 
      transfer to another game locally. (Requires console access to load). 
　
      You can also export a settlement snapshot to papyrus in order to quickly 
      build an AFT Prefab ADDON. (See section X below). The later route is more 
      work,  but offers a way to get your settlement onto consoles like PS4 and 
      XBOX.
      
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. > > > >  Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
  A. Requirements
        
     This mod requires Fallout 4 patch 1.7 or newer.  To find out what version 
     you have, hit ESC within the game and look in the bottom left corner of 
     the System:Save/Load screen.
        
     This Mod does NOT require any DLC. 
        
  B. Manual (Downloaded from NexusMods)
          
     This is probably the safest method as it ensures full control over when 
     you upgrade (or don't upgrade) to the latest version of the mod. Users
     wishing to make use of the Settlement Export capability should be sure
     to get the version with that capability enabled (Available at Fallout 
     Nexus).
         
     1) If you do not already have it, get 7-zip : www.7-zip.org
         
        ** Do not use WinRar to open/extract .7z files. It can corrupt them.
         
     2) Once 7-zip is installed, open the .7z file downloaded from NexusMods 
        Typically you need only double click the file:
         
          AmazingFollowerTweaksFO4_v1_04.7z
         
     3) Within the 7-zip window, select the menu options: 
         
          "Help" -> "About 7-zip"
          
        Ensure you have version 9.20 or greater/newer. If you do not, return to
        step 1 and get the latest version. 
          
     4) The 7-zip window will show 2 files:
           
          /Data
          readme_aft_1_04.txt
          
        Make sure BOTH items are hi-lighted. To hi-light both entries quickly, 
        hit CTRL + A
         
     5) Hit Extract and then [...] to browse to the location of your fallout4
        installation. 
         
        Most people will find it in one of these two locations:
         
          Computer -> C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4
            
            or
            
          Computer -> C:\Program Files\steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4
            
        After you click on and hi-light "Fallout 4", click [OK] and then [OK]
        once more
            
     6) If you previously had AFT installed, you will be prompted to confirm 
        file overwrite for the three files: 
            
        AmazingFollowerTweaks - Main.bsa
        AmazingFollowerTweaks - Textures.bsa
        AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp
            
        Click [Yes] to each file as it comes up
        
        If you did not have AFT previsouly, skip this step.
         
     7) When you start up Fallout 4, go to Mods (Hit Home to skip the login) 
        and make sure AmazingFollowerTweaks mod is checked. I also recommend 
        boosting its priority. This is done by moving the mod to the BOTTOM
        of the load order.
            
     8) For what to expect after starting a new game or loading a save game, 
        see Usage below. 
            
  C. Installing from Bethesda.net
            
     ??? (Someone please email me direction as I have no idea...)
             
  D. Upgrading
             
     Place Holder for future versions
             
  E. Notes
           
     - To Properly uninstall AFT, use the AFT Holotape titled "AFT Settings"
       And select the "Prepare for uninstall" option.  AFT will attempt to 
       undo all changes it has made and shutdown AFT related quests. This will
       help avoid issues should you install other mods that edit followers or 
       decide to re-install AFT at a future date.
                  
  F. Known Issues
　
     - Loading a Prefab can crash your game if done from a settlement where
       you have MANUALLY assigned beds or tasks to the settlement residents. You
       should only load a PREFAB if you are certain you have never MANUALLY 
       assigned a settler to a task at a particular settlement. This is mostly
       a concern when using AFT with existing save games. For more details, see
       Advanced Trouble Shooting below.
          
     - Do not assign ring to managed follower outfits. The ring slot is used to 
       bump the AI and can fail if an outfit includes a ring. (leaving them 
       naked or wearing the wrong clothes)
　
     - When you have multiple followers and you dismiss someone, the wrong 
       NAME may appear in the message announcing the follower that is 
       leaving. The issue is cosmetic, but can be confusing if you are not 
       aware of it. (I will try to fix this in the future or just eliminate
       the message)
              
  G. Trouble Shooting
          
     These are questions I tend to ask all users when problems are reported:
          
     1) Does your version of AFT match the required version of Fallout 4: 
          
        You can get the version of Fallout 4 from the bottom left corner 
        of the Save/Load screen (You have to load a save game first)
          
          AFT Version 1.00 : FO4 Patch 1.7    (minimum) required
          AFT Version 1.03 : FO4 Patch 1.10   (minimum) required
          AFT Version 1.04 : FO4 Patch 1.10   (minimum) required
           
     2) Is AFT at the bottom of your load order?
           
        If you play with multiple mods and discover issues that appear to be 
        related to AFT, try playing with AFT at the bottom of the load order 
        before reporting any issues to me. This helps eliminate the possibility 
        that another mod is breaking AFT because it has a higher priority. 
        
     3) Did you clean your Cache?
           
        Steam -> Library -> (All Games) Fallout 4 -> Properties 
        -> Local Files -> Verify Integrity of Game Cache
        
     4) AFT Master Controller not appearing
           
        If you load an existing game where you have already emerged from Vault 
        111, AFT typically takes 8 to 10 seconds to begin initialization (shows 
        a progress bar). Then another 10 seconds to complete. Items are not 
        added until initialization is complete. (You will see a thank you 
        message)
          
        If you are started a new game, the AFT items will not appear in your  
        inventory until you emerge from Vault 111 (AFT delays initialization 
        until the quest Out of Time begins).        
          
          
     5) Were you using another multi-follower mod before AFT?
        
        Follower mods all tend to change the same core game resources. So if 
        you are loading a save game that previously was exposed to a different 
        Follower Mod, you may encounter issues that appear to be related to AFT 
        but are in fact due to a lingering mod conflict. It is possible for 
        mods to hold onto resources even after they are uninstalled. 
　
        To fix these issues, you have to revert to a save that only had the 
        previous Follower Mod. (You may have to disable AFT/Re-enable the 
        previous Follower mod). Follow the previous mods uninstall instructions 
        (Similar to the instructions this mod provides). If you used a Follower 
        mod that has no uninstall instructions, your only option may be 
        starting a new game.
                              
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. > > > >  Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           
  New Game:
           
    If you start a new game, your first sign that AFT is installed will be some
    new commentary regarding your spouse in (future) Vault 111. Specifically, 
    if you take your spouses wedding ring, the player will mention that they 
    are not a doctor but that they will return (implying they realize the 
    spouse could be saved).
           
    Upon exiting Vault 111, AFT will initialize, a thank you will appear and 
    you will find 2 new items in your inventory:  The AFT Activator and the AFT
    Settings holotape. The AFT Activator will automatically be assigned to 
    Quick Slot 3.
　
  Loading an Existing Save Game:
           
    If you load a save game where you have already exited Vault 111, AFT will 
    immediately begin initializing. During initialization, a progress bar will
    appear as a flashing notification in the upper left corner. Once 
    initialization is complete, a thank you message will appear and you will 
    find 2 new items in your inventory:  The AFT Activator and the AFT Settings
    holotape. You will also find that the AFT Activator has already been 
    assigned to Quick Slot 3.
                                  
  Terminology : 
           
    Managed Follower : Any NPC that is being managed by AFT. AFT can manage up 
                       to 32 NPCs. For example, AFT can be used to LOCATE 
                       anyone it manages. 
　
    Active Follower  : An NPC that actively follows the player around in the
                       game. AFT supports up to 5 active followers. 6 if you
                       include Dogmeat. 
           
  A. AFT Activator
           
     The AFT Activator is a small device that appears in your inventory in the
     AID category. It is a usable inventory item, so it can be assigned to a 
     quick slot. The AFT Activator is auto-assigned to slot 3 during 
     initialization. You can choose to assign it elsewhere if you wish (or 
     not assign it at all). 
           
     When used, the activator will raise your PipBoy and you will see one of
     three menus appear depending on what was under the crosshair when the
     activator was activated.
           
     If the crosshair was on a Managed NPC, you will see all AFT commands and 
     options with the followers name at the top of the screen. 
           
        ----------------------
        <FOLLOWER NAME>:
        ----------------------
        > Actions
        > Gear
        > Combat AI
        > Info
        > Appearance
        > Settings
        > Tools                             
        ----------------------
        > Select ALL Followers
        > Cancel
        ----------------------
           
     If the crosshair was on an unmanaged but eligible NPC, you will see import
     options and an option to scan the NPC for more information.
           
        ----------------------
        IMPORT:
        ----------------------
        > Scan NPC
        > Force Recruit NPC?
        > Cancel
        ----------------------
           
     If the crosshair had no target, you will see a list of commands that 
     affect ALL Active Followers (Equivalent to selecting everyone). Not all 
     menu options will appear in this mode of operation. 
           
        ----------------------
        ALL FOLLOWER MODE:
        ----------------------
        > Actions

        > Tools                             
        ----------------------
        > Select Follower
        > Cancel
        ----------------------
           
     NOTES: 
　
       - The activator will not work on NPCs who are in combat. 
           
       - Using the activator on an Active Follower will randomly result in 
         Follower commentary. Selecting Additional commands may result in even
         more commentary. This provides immersion but also introduces delays. 
         Users who prefer a more responsive interface can disable follower 
         commentary associated with the activator from the followers chat 
         settings
           
       - Should you lose the activator, you can use the Aft Settings Holotape
         to spawn another one. 
              
           
     1) Actions
           
        A list of commands you can issue to the Follower(s). Many of these 
        commands mirror the options you see when you talk to Companions.

        DETAILS:
             
        a) Get Behind Me
             
           Causes the follower you are speaking with to teleport behind you.
           When No Follower is selected, you will see an option to summon all,
           which teleports all active followers in front of you.
              
           Note: 
           
           - If you are bumping into an active follower and you draw your 
             weapon, this Method is executed automatically. 
           
           - There are some areas of the game where Summon All is disabled
              for immersion reasons.
           
        b) Wait Here \ Follow Me : 
                      
           "Follow Me": 
             
             Appears if the follower is an Active Follower in wait mode 
             Selecting will end wait mode.
             
           "Wait Here": 
             
             Appears if the follower is an Active Follower currently in Follow
             mode. Selecting will cause follower to enter Wait mode. 
           
        c) Fetch My PowerArmor
           
           Causes the players PowerArmor to teleport to the follower, as if the
           follower fetched it.
           
        d) Enter\Exit Power Armor
           
           "Enter Power Armor":
               
             - SELECTED MODE:
               
               Appears if Follower is not wearing Power Armor but has one 
               assigned. On selection, the NPC will enter their PA. Running up 
               to it if it is nearby or the PA will be teleported to them if it 
               is not.
               
             - ALL FOLLOWER MODE:
               
               All NPCs with assigned PowerArmors who are not wearing them will
               enter their PowerArmors. May cause PowerArmors to teleport to
               followers.
               
               
           "Exit Power Armor": 
               
             - SELECTED MODE:
               
               Appears if NPC is wearing PowerArmor. Causes them to exit.
               
             - ALL FOLLOWER MODE:
               
               All NPCs who are wearing PowerArmor will exit their PowerArmor.
                      
           POWER ARMOR ASSIGNEMENT:
           
               To assign a PowerArmor to a follower simply have them enter a
               power armor. Assignment occurs when they enter. 
　
               For those unfamiliar with the process, Start Command-Mode by 
               "grabbing" the follower from a distance. On PC, you use the [e]
               key by default. This will cause the target hair to show context
               sensitive information based on what the target hair is hovering 
               over. Hover over a PowerArmor and tell the Follower to Enter. 
             
               This assigns the PowerArmor to the Follower. It will remain  
               assigned until another NPC or the player enters the PowerArmor. 
             
               The easiest way to un-assign PowerArmor is to have the player
               enter a followers PA.
             
        e) Setup\Teardown Camp
           
           "Setup": 
             
             Appears if Camp is not already setup. The command scans the 
             terrain around you and builds camp based on characteristics.
             Construction can take up to a minute depending on what you have 
             enabled and purchased.
           
           "Teardown": 
           
             Appears if Camp is currently setup. If you issue the command in 
             the vicinity of camp, camp will immediately begin to fade. 
             Teardown can take up to two minutes depending on the complexity of 
             Your camp and what you have purchased/enabled.
           
             If you issue Teardown when you are away from camp, a 24 hour delay
             penalty is added. (1 game day). This is to simulate the amount of 
             time it would take your followers to return to camp, tear it down
             and return to you.  Activating Teardown a second time while the 
             penalty window is active will tell you how much time is left 
             before camp is available. You can cancel the penalty by returning
             to camp and issuing the command from camp itself. 
           
           NOTES : 
           
             Special things happen the first time you setup camp. See the Aft 
             Camp section below for more details. 
                      
        f) Come with Me\Dismiss
           
           "Come with Me": 
             
             Appears on Managed Followers who are not actively following the 
             Player. It causes the follower to begin following the player. If
             you are at maximum capacity, another follower will be dismissed 
             automatically. For any imported Followers, this may be the only 
             way to tell them to follow you again after being dismissed.
           
           "Dismiss": 
              
             Appears on Active Followers and will cause them to stop following
             the player and return to their assigned Home. Since AFT has a
             dedicated home assignment menu, dismissed followers will not 
             prompt you for a home location unless the NPC doesn’t have one.
           
     2) Gear
           
        Use this menu to configure outfits or issue commands for bulk inventory
        management.

        a) Trade 
                 
           Opens up the followers inventory.
                 
        b) Outfits
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Outfits
                 ----------------------
                 [ ] Set/Use Standard Outfit
                 [ ] Set/Use Combat Outfit
                 [ ] Set/Use City Outfit
                 [ ] Set/Use Camp Outfit
                 Clear All Outfits
                 ----------------------
                 
           Standard Outfit:
                 
             The default outfit that gets used when no other conditions apply.
             If you only setup 1 outfit, this is the one to setup.
                 
           Combat Outfit:
                 
             Equipped when combat begins. Unequipped when combat ends if the 
             environment matches another configured outfit. Setting a 
             Combat+Standard outfit is an easy way to cause auto-toggling of 
             gear that you only want during combat. Whether it is simply a 
             helmet toggle or a full wardrobe change.
                 
           City Outfit:
                 
             Equipped when entering settlements and cities. When leaving a 
             settlement/city, the Outfit will be removed if the environment 
             matches another configured outfit.
                 
           Camp Outfit:
                 
             Equipped when approaching AFT Camp.  When leaving camp, the Outfit
             will be removed if the environment matches another configured 
             outfit.
                            
           [ ] SET/Use <TYPE> OUTFIT:
                 
             When you "Set" an outfit, the trade menu will open allowing you to
             make adjustments. When the trade menu closes, AFT takes a snapshot
             of what the follower is wearing, assigning it to the outfit. 
                 
             Toggling an outfit OFF will disable/clear the outfit but will also
             equip the outfit in the process. Users can use a quick toggle 
             Off/On to make updates or just get a glimpse of what is assigned. 
                 
           CLEAR ALL OUTFITS:
                 
             Unsets all outfits assigned to the selected NPC (SELECTED 
             MODE) or all Active Followers (ALL FOLLOWERS MODE). Unlike 
             other toggles, this will not restore any outfits. Followers
             will keep wearing what they have on and simply stop reacting
             to outfit change events.
                 
        c) Dejunk
                 
           Transfers most items considered "Junk" from the players inventory to
           the followers inventory. Supports a large list of well known items. 
           Exceptions are made for items required for important quests.
                 
           This command ignores the follower's Carry Limits making it easy to 
           bring large amounts of junk with you to support settlement 
           renovations.
                 
        d) Dedupe
                 
           Scans the players inventory for duplicates and transfers any found
           to the follower. The idea is that unique and quest items are 
           unlikely to be found in pairs. So dedupe is relatively safe in the
           sense that you are unlikely to lose anything important. 
                 
           A number of exceptions are in place to protect common support items.
           For example, Fusion Cores, Stimpaks, lockpicks, ammo and a number of
           other items are ignored by the command. 
                 
           Like Dejunk, this command ignores the follower's Carry Limits.
　
           Dedupe is not available when the player is in PowerArmor. 
                 
        e) Unequip All
                 
           The command is pretty self explanatory. A few notes: 
                 
           - If the follower is in PowerArmor, they will exit the PowerArmor, 
             unequip all and then Re-enter the PowerArmor to avoid PowerArmor
             related glitches.
                 
           - Following the command, only PLAYABLE items will be visible in 
             the followers inventory. If the follower was wearing unplayable
             items, you may not be able to re-equip them. Nick Valentines 
             Trench Coat had this issue. AFT includes fixes for the games 
             standard 13 followers, but I recommend saving before using  
             against any imported or DLC followers.
                 
        f) More    
                 
           Various commands to help manage inventory and junk in bulk:
                 
                 ----------------------
                 More
                 ----------------------
                 Convert Junk to Scrap
                 Sell unused/ALL Gear
                 Give me your scrap
                 Give me unused Gear
                 ----------------------
             
           CONVERT JUNK TO SCRAP:
             
             This command instructs a follower to convert all the junk in their
             possession into scrap. You might do this to lighten the load or 
             just to keep tabs on how much of each type of scrap you have 
             collected. 
             
             Since followers can have massive accumulations of junk, a progress
             bar is provided while the operation is underway.
             
           SELL UNUSED GEAR:
             
             This command will convert a followers inventory into caps. The 
             only items that will remain are those assigned to an outfit. If no 
             outfits are assigned, it will appear as Sell ALL Gear.
             
             Background : The idea behind the command is that you are basically
             sending your  follower on an errand to sell their gear where ever 
             they can at a reduced price. As a result, You wont get as many
             caps, but you also don't have to spend hours/days running around 
             the commonwealth looking for buyers (With caps to spend). 
             
             When issued from ALL FOLLOWERS MODE, you will first receive a 
             confirmation prompt. 
             
           GIVE ME YOUR SCRAP
             
             Transfers all the raw scrap to the player. Does NOT transfer 
             non-scrapped Junk.
             
             If used in ALL FOLLOWERS MODE, it will appear as Give me ALL Scrap
             
           GIVE ME UNUSED GEAR
             
             Transfers any items that are not assigned to a follower outfit to 
             the player. 
             
        NOTES:
             
          - If an outfit has a weapon, the ammo that the weapon uses is also 
            considered part of the outfit even if the ammo wasn't equipped 
            when the outfit was created.
             
          - A special command called "Add Nick Items" Appears at the top of the
            Gear menu if the follower is specifically Nick Valentine. This
            command adds an assortment of Nick-Compatible accessories and 
            outfits to Nicks inventory that you can see and use to optionally
            change his look and appearance.  
             
          - Any items assigned to an outfit are protected from Bulk inventory 
            commands. For example, if you say "Give me unused Gear", you will 
            get everything the follower has... except items assigned to one of
            the outfits.  
             
          - Outfits do not have to be different. If nothing else, each outfit
            provides an opportunity to flag an additional weapon as being 
            protected from bulk commands. Many users for example want their
            followers to have a primary, secondary and backup melee weapon
            to account for ammo depletion.
             
     3) Combat AI
             
        Follower Specific options for Combat:
             
              ----------------------
              Combat AI
              ----------------------
              > Distance
              > Style
              > Caution
              [ ] Toggle PA Helmet On/Off
              [ ] Ignore Friendly Hits
              ----------------------
                  
        DETAILS:  
                 
        a) Distance
                  
                 ----------------------
                 Distance
                 ----------------------
                 [ ] Near
                 [*] Medium
                 [ ] Far
                 ----------------------
                 
           NEAR: ( about 8 feet away)
                 
             Sets the follower AI to remain close to the player during combat.
             Typically assigned to followers when the player is specializing 
             in sniper style combat. (keeps followers from running off and 
             getting in the way of your distant targets). 
                 
           MEDIUM: ( about 16 feet away)
                 
             Sets the follower AI to remain moderately close to the player 
             during combat. This allows both melee and ranged followers to 
             engage enemies while remaining close enough to the player to also 
             offer some diversion and protection. 
                 
             This is the games default distance and makes the most sense if the
             player is not specialized as a melee fighter or sniper.
                 
           FAR: ( about 32 feet away).
                 
             Sets the follower AI to keep their distance from the player during
             combat. Typically assigned to followers when the player character
             specializes in melee combat. (keeps your followers away so they 
             don't get caught up in your sweeping area attacks)
                 
        b) Style  
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Style
                 ----------------------
                 [*] Aggressive
                 [ ] Defensive
                 ----------------------
                 
           AGGRESSIVE:
                 
             Sets follower aggression to "Aggressive". Aggressive Followers 
             attack enemies on sight. (Even if the player is sneaking and
             hasn't been detected yet).
                 
           DEFENSIVE:
                 
             Sets follower aggression to "Unaggressive". Unaggressive Followers
             will not attack anyone unless they are directly attacked first.
                 
        c) Caution
                 
           Caution affects when a follower decides to run from combat. The 
           decision is based on a combination of Follower Health and Enemy 
           Difficulty.

                 [ ] Average
                 [ ] Brave
                 [*] Foolhardy
                 ----------------------
                 
           Coward    - Will run at first sign of combat. 
           Cautious  - Fight if Enemy is easy and health > 75%. Otherwise run.
           Average   - Fight until health gets below 50%
           Brave     - Fight until health gets below 25%
           Foolhardy - Fight to the death. 
                 
                 
           NOTE: By default followers are made Foolhardy since they can't 
                 die. However if you set mortality to enable follower death, 
                 Caution automatically changes to Cautious. 
                  
                 
        d) [ ] Toggle PA Helmet On/Off
                 
           Toggled on to have the follower automatically un-equip the helmet of
           their PowerArmor when outside combat and put it back on when combat
           begins. 
                  
           When travelling with multiple followers wearing PowerArmor, I found
           this necessary as it was hard to tell who was who without being able
           to see their  faces. 
                 
        e) [ ] Ignore Friendly Hits
                  
           Determines if follower will react to friendly fire. By default, 
           Followers have this option checked. However if you want a more 
           immersive experience, you can uncheck the value. 
                 
           When unchecked, if you hit a follower a certain number of times, 
           they will automatically dismiss themselves and turn hostile. When 
           this happens, you must distance yourself from them and wait 24 
           hours (game time) before approaching them again. 
                 
     4) Info     
                  
        Scan followers to learn things about them. You can generate a full 
        report (ALL) or generate a report for a specific area using the menu
        options:
              
              ----------------------
              Info
              ----------------------
              All
              Stats
              Relationship 
              Reactions 
              AI
              Traits
              Effects
              Perks
              Factions 
              Keywords
              ----------------------
              
        a) All
             
           Scans for everything and returns a "book" that contains all known
           information regarding the NPC. The scan normally takes 5 to 10 secs.
             
        b) Stats
             
           Scans for SPECIAL attributes (Strength, Perception, Endurance, 
           Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck) as well as Resistances and
           overall health. Alos reveals kill count of each follower.
             
        c) Relationship 
             
           Relationship: 
             
             A single term that summarizes your current relationship with the 
             follower:
             
                Hate, Disdain, Neutral, Friend, Admiration,  Confidant, 
                Infatuated, In Love
             
           Romance Option: 
             
             Indicates if the follower Can be romanced
             
           Is Romanced:
             
             Indicates if follower is currently in a romance with the player. 
             
           Player Opinion:
             
             Provides score which reflects how much the follower likes or 
             dislikes the player based on an accumulation of observed actions
             and traits. The score ranges from -1100 to 1100 
             
             Most followers start off at 0. At certain threshold points, the 
             follower relationship may shift from say... Neutral to Friend or
             Neutral to Disdain.  The closest thresholds are provided above and
             below the Player Opinion score to show how close you are from a 
             relationship shift in the positive or negative direction.  
             
             Relationship shifts are normally (but not always) accompanied by 
             Companion specific comments, conversations and scenes. 
             
        d) Reactions:
             
           Provides a comprehensive list of actions and events that Fallout 4
           monitors and shows the selected Follower's reaction to those events.
           
           See Section "IV.A Recognized Reactions" below for full listing
             
           Ratings are color coded for easier reading. Like's are colored Green
           while dislikes are colored red.  
             
        e) AI
               
           Aggression:
             
             Determines when or if your followers will attack other characters. 
             
             - Unaggressive:    Only attack if hit by another NPC
             - Aggressive:      Attack enemies on Sight
             - Very Aggressive: Attack non-allies on Sight
             - Frenzied:        Attack everyone on sight
             
           Confidence:
             
             Confidence determines how low your followers health can get before 
             they begin to run from a fight. 
             
             - Cowardly:        No damage necessary. Immediately Run
             - Cautious:        Run if health below 75%
             - Average:         Run if health below 50% 
             - Brave:           Run if health below 75%
             - Foolhardy:       Never Run
             
           Assistance:
             
             Assistance determines who a follower will "Follow into" combat.
             For example, the player is considers a friend and an ally. Even if
             your followers aggression is set to Unaggressive, they may begin
             fighting when the player takes a hit, even though they didn't 
             receive it directly. 
             
             - Help No One:   Never enter combat because of someone else.
             - Helps Allies:  Assist anyone belonging to a friendly group.
             - Helps Friends: Help "friends" regardless of group association.
             
           Morality: 
             
             Morality controls whether an NPCs will commit crimes or refuse 
             commands against certain people, groups or owned containers.
             
             - No Crime:        Wont do anything considered unethical
             - Property Crime:  Will steal from owned containers
             - Violent Crime:   Will attack Non-allies + Property Crime
             - Any Crime:       Will attack Allies + Violent Crime
               
        f) Traits
             
             
           Race:
             
             Some NPCs can change their race as part of the game (Most notably
             Curie). AFT also allows you to change follower race for 
             appearance. AFT tracks both original race and current race. 
             
             By default, synths are treated as Humans and display as Humans to
             prevent spoiling quests. The AFT Settings holotape includes a 
             setting to reveal Synths under Misc Settings. 
             
           Home Location:
             
             Managed NPCs will have an Original and Current Home location. The
             Current Home Location is the place that the Follower will go if 
             they are dismissed.
             
           Unique: 
             
             This is a technical trait that indicates only 1 copy of that 
             specific NPC is allowed in the game. (No duplicates).
             
             Generally speaking, NPC's with unique names are unique. This 
             Property is necessary for the Sculpt system to work.
             
           Templated:
             
             Templated characters are normally generated by scripts and involve
             randomized elements. IE: a head from here, an outfit from there, a 
             weapon from somewhere. NPCs that show up at your settlements are 
             generally templated. 
             
             The game continuously enforces the traits of templated NPCs. For 
             this reason, you generally can't change their appearance. Sculpt 
             and Set Name wont work for example. (They work very briefly, but 
             the NPCs changes back so fast all you see is a blink).
             
             Curie is a templated NPC. However her traits are not randomized. 
             Her templates are used to enforce a race change during her quest. 
             Unfortunately, since she is templated, you can't sculpt her
             appearance.
             
             For Curie, we implemented a special work around. You can assign an
             entirely new pre-fab face/Body from a small collection we created. 
　
           Managed Slot
　
            The "Slot" or ID within AFT that the NPC is using. A number between
            1 and 32.
             
        g) Effects
             
           AFT may not be able to account for every item, potion, recipe or 
           perk mod  you install, but under the hood most of these mods end up
           applying one of a few dozen effects. This screen lists these lower
           level general effects. You will typically see some overlap between 
           what you see here and in other areas such as Perks.
             
           See section IV.B "Recognized Effects" below
           for a full listing of detected effects. 
                          
        h) Factions
             
           A Faction is a named group or organization. For example, there is
           faction for Diamond City and a faction for the Brotherhood of Steel. 
           A Faction for raiders and a faction for Synths. Much of the fighting
           that occurs in Fallout 4 is due to Faction membership and the 
           relationships defined between the factions. 
             
           When a follower is a member of a faction, they may show loyalty to
           that faction by attacking other NPCs on sight because they are a 
           member of an enemy faction. They may also refuse to attack other
           faction members. 
                         
           Here, we show what factions the NPC is/was a member of. 
             
           See section IV.C "Recognized Factions" below for a full listing of 
           detected Factions. 
             
           NOTES:
             
           AFT removes followers from all factions to ensure loyalty and avoid
           unintended hostilities. When used on a managed NPC, the factions 
           shown reflect a snapshot of the follower's factions BEFORE they 
           joined the player. If you are scanning an unmanaged NPC, then 
           Factions will be current.
           
        i) Perks
             
           Player Perks are well known, get cool names and are chosen by the
           player as the player levels up. NPC perks are less glamorous, more
           limited and also generally very direct. You will see perks for 
           things like adding damage resistance or increasing attack damage.
             
           See section IV.D "Recognized Perks" below for a full listing of 
           detected Perks. 
                          
        j) Keywords
              
           Keywords are small nuggets of information used in making AI 
           decisions. For example, there is a keyword that allows an NPC to
           attempt to pick locks. Keywords can also be used to determine things
           like which seat of the Vertibird the NPC will climb into. Some 
           keywords operate like spell effects. The keyword ImmuneFrenzy grants
           immunity to frenzy just like a spell could.
             
           Keywords are broad in scope, but as they are so heavily used by the
           game engine, we felt it was worthwhile to scan for the most common 
           ones and show them.
　
           See section IV.E "Recognized Keywords" below for a full listing of 
           detected Keywords. 
                          
     5) Appearance
             
        The Appearance menu offers number of ways you can customize your 
        followers appearance. Some commands such as Scale will work against
        any NPC or creature. Other commands like Sculpt are very picky and will
        only work with Humans and Ghouls who are both unique and non-templated.
        Most commands are neither as lenient as Scale or as strict as Sculpt 
        and fall somewhere in the middle. 
                 
        For these reasons, some companions are more customizable than others, 
        but every NPC can be customized to some degree
                          
              ----------------------

              ----------------------
                   
        a) Pose  
                   
           The Pose Menu contains a number of options for posing the NPC. 
                 
                 ----------------------
                 Pose
                 ----------------------
                 Browse
                 > Select
                 Move/Rotate
                 Stop
                 ----------------------
             
             You can only pose humanoid companions. This option will not appear
             if the follower is a dog or non-humanoid robot like a Mr. Handy.
                 
           BROWSE:
                 
             Visually browse the various poses applied to the NPC and choose 
             the one you wish to use or cancel. On selection, begins a Dialogue
             Scene where the Right and Left options cycle poses and the up and
             down options choose/exit.
                 
           SELECT:
                 
             Brings up a list of all Poses and allows you to jump directly to a
             named pose without going through the Pose Browser (saves time).
                 
           MOVE/ROTATE:
                 
             NPC position becomes locked to the player so that as the player 
             moves so does the NPC (like picking them up). Dialogue menu arrows
             allow you to rotate, lean and shift the follower in small detailed
             increments for fine-grained placement. 
                 
           STOP:  
                 
             Ends the current Pose.
                 
           NOTES: 
                 
             If you pose an ACTIVE follower, the pose will automatically end
             once you get more than about 15 feet from them. 
                 
        b) Scale 
                 
           The Scale Menu contains a number of options for changing the size of
           an NPC. Worn items such as clothes and power armor will scale up or 
           down to match the Follower.
                          
                 ----------------------
                 Scale
                 ----------------------
                 200 %
                 150 %
                 125 %
                 105 %
                 95 %
                 80 %
                 66 %
                 50 %
                 Reset
                 ----------------------
                 
           PERCENTAGE:
                 
             If the value is greater than 100%, the NPC will get larger. If the
             value is less than 100%, the NPC will get smaller.
                 
           RESET:
                 
             Returns the NPC to their original proportions. This is the only 
             command that ignores the Followers current size. 
                 
           NOTES: 
                 
             Scale is always based on the Followers CURRENT size. So if you 
             scale a follower to 200% twice, they will be %400. You can mix 
             and match commands to achieve values outside the 8 listed above. 
                 
        c) Parts 
                 
           While the SCULPT command insists on Human or Ghoul races, the PARTS
           command is less picky. It uses papyrus commands to force models onto
           the NPC and can even offer access to content not available from the 
           sculpt command. For example, you can assign hair to Nick, a beard
           to Cait or Synth Eyes to Preston. We can even make Piper look like 
           Nate (with some scaling). The parts command has no restrictions. 
                          
                 ----------------------
                 Parts
                 ----------------------

           NOTES:
                 
             The first time you use PARTS/SCULPT against an NPC, AFT unlocks 
             the FACE for editing. The technical trick we use to do this 
             removes any existing EXTRAS added to the face (blemishes, scars, 
             freckles, etc...). You can of coarse add them back, though you 
             may not know exactly what they were. You will recieve a 
             confirmation prompt regarding this when you use either of those
             two commands. 
                       
        d) Race    
                   
                 ----------------------
                 Race
                 ----------------------
                 Human
                 SynthGen1 
                 SynthGen2
                 Dog
                 Rabid Dog
                 FEV Dog
                 ----------------------
                  
           AFT allows you to change the racial appearance of your follower. For
           example you can use AFT to make Hancock a much more attractive human
           for those wanting to romance him. You can turn Codsworth into a 
           Human (Synth) so that he can operate PowerArmor and be a more 
           effective fighter. You can turn strong into a Behemoth or a talking
           Dog (both relatively entertaining). 
                  
           AFT restricts the available options on a per-companion basis to 
           those deemed "safe". So for example, Piper has very few options 
           because testing revealed she wasn't compatible with most races.  
                  
        e) Sculpt/Edit Body
                  
           The Sculpt command starts up the games surgery menu, only with the 
           companion as the target instead of the Player.  This is the same 
           editor you used to customize the players appearance when the game 
           started. So it allows full editing of the appearance from hair color
           to facial blemishes. 
                  
           Unfortunately, the built-in surgery menu only supports humans and 
           Ghouls. If you try to plug in any other race (supermutant, synth, 
           MrHandy), it will crash the game. Therefore AFT does checks and only
           presents the menu if the race is human or ghoul. 
                  
           Sometimes, this command will say "Edit Body". That means that AFT 
           has determined that edits to the NPC's face will likely fail, but 
           you can still use the Surgery Menu to change the body proportions. 
           This is most common with randomly generated NPCs you pick up at 
           settlements and random encounters. 
                  
           NOTES: 
                  
             The first time you use PARTS/SCULPT against an NPC, AFT unlocks 
             the FACE for editing. The technical trick we use to do this 
             removes any existing EXTRAS added to the face (blemishes, scars, 
             freckles, etc...). You will receive a confirmation prompt 
             regarding this when you use either of those two commands. 
                  
        f) Posture 
                   
           Posture is the stance that the follower takes when they are 
           relaxing. Some NPCs such as Mama Murphey use the elderly posture. 
           You can change the NPC's posture if you wish to add or remove 
           behavior. Note: You wont really notice unless the Follower relaxes.  
                  
        g) Expression
                  
           Expression is a visual representation of someone's mood. Like
           posture, it only gets used when the follower relaxes and even then
           it may be so brief that it is easy to miss.
                  
        h) New Body
                   
           Currently, NEW BODY only appears with Curie and only if you complete
           her quest to become a synth. It allows you to assign Curie to one of
           several pre-fabricated bodies/face combos. This may become available
           on other robotic companions in a future version.
                  
     6) Settings   
                  
              ----------------------

              ----------------------
              > Assign Name
              > Assign Home
              > Personality
              > Chat Settings
              > AI Tweaks
              [ ] Enable Pack Mule
              [ ] Enable Ammo Use
              [ ] Enable PA Damage
              [ ] Enable Follower Death
              ----------------------
                 
        a) Assign Name
                 
           Select one of 80 unique names to assign to your followers. For 
           example, give Dogmeat your own unique name. This is particularly
           handy when importing NPCs that have generic names like "Settler",
           "Guard" and "Resident".  It will also work against the original
           13 companions.
                  
           What to Expect:
                 
           - When bringing up the PipBoy, the assigned name will always appear
             at the top. 
                    
           - AFT also attempts to change the name that appears when you hover 
             the target hair over the NPC. However this can sometimes fail if 
             the NPC is currently being used by a higher priority quest/script
             at the time you attempt to assign the name. (See Notes)
                 
           NOTES: 
                     
             When you ring a settlement Bell to summon all settlers, a high
             quest/script directs all the NPCs assigned to the settlement to 
             the bell. For this reason, you should almost never attempt to name 
             an NPC while a settlement bell is in effect.
                      
             The best way to avoid this specific issue is to sleep for a few 
             hours before attempting to name your companions.  
                 
             The target hair name change is less likely to work for core 
             companions if you in the middle of their personal quest.
                  
             I've never gotten the Target Hair Name to change for Curie. Not
             sure why.
                 
        b) Assign Home
                 
           Selecting this option will pop up a message box that prompts you for
           a Home location. This is the location that the Follower will return
           to when they are dismissed.
                 
           Your options can include:
                 
             - Original Home Location
             - Settlement
             - Camp
             - Current Location
                 
           The message will include the name of the original home location so 
           you know where you would be sending them. 
                 
           Settlement will pop up yet another menu so you can select one of 
           your settlements.
                 
           CAMP will only appear if you have setup camp at some point in the 
           past. 
                 
        c) Personality
                 
           The original 13 "core" companions all come with reactions to things
           they like and don't like. This can make travelling with some of them
           difficult. So AFT includes some tweaks to help ease the friction.
                 
                 ----------------------

                 [ ] Disable Dislike/Hate Reactions
                 [ ] Disable Like/Love Reactions

           [ ] Disable Dislike/Hate
                 
             You can have followers simply ignore things they normally don't 
             like. NOTE That ignoring something will not stop the commentary. 
             It will simply stop the Player Opinion score from dropping. 
                 
           [ ] Disable Like/Love
                 
             You can have followers simply ignore things they normally like 
             or love. NOTE That ignoring something will not stop the commentary. 
             It will simply stop the Player Opinion score from increasing. 
                 
           [ ] Convert Dislike/Hate to Like/Love
                 
             This setting will actual cause the relationship to improve when 
             you do things the NPC normally doesn't like. For example, stepping
             into PowerArmor while travelling with Strong. 
                 
             For immersion, this setting automatically disables negative
             commentary from the NPC. If you wish to hear the negative comments
             despite  the reaction reversal, you can uncheck Ignore Negative 
             Comments in the Commentary section after you enable this.  
                 
           [ ] Convert Like/Love to Dislike/Hate
                 
             This setting will actual cause the relationship to diminish when 
             you do things the NPC normally likes. For example, helping
             settlements while travelling with Preston. 
                 
             For immersion, this setting automatically disables positive
             commentary from the NPC. If you wish to hear the positive comments
             despite  the reaction reversal, you can uncheck Ignore Negative 
             Comments in the Commentary section after you enable this.  
                 
        d) Chat Settings
                 
           The original 13 "core" companions all come preconfigured with things
           they say in response to what they observe. With up to 5 companions, 
           there can be a lot of NPCs all talking at once. So AFT includes 
           commentary management.

             The follower will no longer say things when they observe something
             they don't like. Checking this setting alone will not stop their 
             opinion score from decreasing. This toggle only stops the 
             commentary.
                 
           [ ] Disable General Comments
                 
             The follower will no longer say things about the mundane things
             they observe such as looting corpses or taking radiation damage. 
                 
           [ ] Disable Positive Comments
                 
             The follower will no longer say things when they observe something
             they like. Note that checking this setting alone will not stop 
             their opinion score from increasing. This toggle only stops the

           [ ] Disable Activator Comments
                 
             The follower will no longer say things when you activate them 
             using the AFT activator. 
                 
           GLOBAL CHAT SETTINGS...
                 
             A convenience link to the Global Chat settings, which is where you 
             control things like whether AFT should make NPCs talk in turn and
             how many comments are allowed per event.

           [ ] Sync PowerArmor use w/Player
                 
             When toggled, the follower will enter and exit their assigned 
             Power Armor when the player enter and exits power armor.
                 
           [ ] Sync Weapon use w/Player
                 
             When toggled, the follower will draw there weapon when they see 
             the player draw a weapon. When not toggled, they will wait until 
             they see a threat.
                 
             Defaults for core companions are based on background and 
             personality. For example, Danse is military trained, so he draws 
             with the player. Meanwhile, Hancock is laid back, so he doesn't. 
             You can of coarse change the settings if you wish. 
                 
           [ ] Disable Auto Relax
                 
             When untoggled, followers will wander, sit down, talk to nearby
             strangers, etc... when the player holsters their weapon. When 
             toggled, they will not do these things and remain more alert. 
                          
           [ ] Avoid Traps
                 
             When toggled, Followers will not set off physical traps even if 
             they accidently run into them (including mines).
　
           [ ] Track Kills
　
             AFT begins tracking kills for the NPC during combat. This option 
             uses ONHIT events for tracking, so it may cause lag on slower 
             machines. Kill Count can be seen under INFO -> Stats
                 
        f) [ ] Enable Pack Mule
                 
             When toggled on, follower carry capacity increased to 2000 lbs. 
                 
        g) [ ] Enable Ammo Use
　
           Uncheck to cause follower to have unlimited ammo
　
        h) [ ] Enable PA Damage
　
           Uncheck to prevent damage to Follower PA. 
　
        i) [ ] Allow Follower Death
                 
             Name says it all. Toggle will allow followers to die. NOTE: (Nick, 
             Dogmeat and Piper are essential until certain game milestones are
             complete.)

             Used to quickly scrap a settlement. By default, it will scrap 
             everything, that can be scrapped and transfer it to the settlement 
             workbench. 
                    
             The method takes you to a page of options where you can filter
             what you would like to remove.  For example, you may wish to leave
             things you can't re-create with the Workshop like living trees. 
             
             WARNING: If you clear a settlement and there is a settler actively
                      harvesting a food plant, it will crash the game. 
　
                      This is generally not an issue when used on newly freed 
                      settlements that lack any settlers (as intended). But can 
                      be an issue when used to clear existing settlements. 
　
                      If your settlement has settlers, make sure to manually
                      store all food items in the workbench before issuing the 
                      command. (Total settlement food should equal zero).  
                      Conversely, you can filter out food items from the Clear
                      Settlement filters. 
             
           RESET BUILD LIMIT
             
             If you are working on a settlement and your size bar fills up, you
             can issue this command the reset it to 0.
             
           LOAD PREFAB
             
             Searches for any installed Prefabs and displays them one at a 
             time. By Default MOST settlements have at least 1 Prefab that
             includes a Wall Only and Full Build option (See credits below for
             list of default prefabs included with AFT and their prices)
             
             Prefabs cost money, but don't forget you can use Clear Settlement 
             in conjunction with the "Sell all gear" command to quickly convert 
             settlement scrap into caps.
　
               WARNING:
　
                 Prefabs are meant to be loaded when a settlement is first 
                 liberated. If you load prefabs into existing settlements that 
                 already have assigned settlers, the game may crash.
　
　
             Wall Only Prefabs do not include housing, defenses, electricity, 
             food or water. They also generally do not clear the settlement.
             Full build Prefabs always include the Wall. If the Wall is 
             purchased first, the cost of the wall is subtracted from the 
             Prefab. 
             
             By default, AFT Does not include Prefabs for Bunker Hill, Covenant 
             Or the AirPort. However AFT Addon-Mods will likely soon be 
             available that expand the selection for those areas.
                    
           SAVE PREFAB     
                    
             This option only appears if you are running the PC version 
             of the mod. Furthermore, for the command to work, logging
             must be enabled which requires additional steps (See "III.E 
             Creating Your Own Settlement Snapshots" below).

               a progress bar to indicate time until completion. Typically 
               takes about a minute. When finished, it will tell you the name 
               of the log file  (Basically the name of the settlement). 
               
               See III.E Below for instructions what what to do After a Save
               To load the settlement elsewhere. 
 
                    
             - TO PAPYRUS:
                     
               On Activation, takes a "snapshot" of the current settlement with
               a progress bar to indicate time until completion. Typically 
               takes about a minute. When finished, it will tell you the name 
               of the log file with the code in it (Basically the name of the 
               settlement). 
                     
               Unlike Batch files which can be executed as-is, Papyrus code
               Needs to be pasted into a Mod Template (Requires Creation kit)
               The steps are outlined below in:
　
               "Section VIII. Making an AFT addon mod"
　
               When the steps are followed, the settlement will become a new 
               Option within AFT and can even be distributed to Consoles such 
               as XBOX and PS4. 
                     
             NOTES:  
                     
               The item scan used by SAVE is not comprehensive. It includes all
               the constructible items that came with the vanilla game as well 
               as a limited number of non-constructible items.(About 1200 items
               in total). It is the same list of items used when Scrapping a 
               settlement.
                     
               Use of items provided by other mods or DLC will not be 
               recognized.
                     
        c) Unmanage NPC
                     
           A menu will appear listing the names of all managed NPCs. Select a 
           name and AFT will unmanage the follower, making their slot available
           for someone else. 
                     
           When an NPC is unmanaged, AFT attempts to undo any changes made to
           the NPC to the maximum extent possible. This includes restoring any 
           "Original" values such as factions, race and body parts. Some 
           changes can not be undone. For example, changes made using the 
           script menu.
                    
        d) QUEST: Camp Expansion
                       
           This option appears while the AFT Camp Expansion quest is running. 
           Selecting this menu will give you a summary of the current task and
           offer a buy-out option if you have the caps. Once AFT Camp Expansion
           is complete, this menu option goes away. (Camp can be further 
           expanded with purchases from the Camp Terminal)
                          
     8) Follower Selection
             
        a) Selecting All Followers
             
           Shown when the AFT Master Controller is used on a managed follower. 
           It allows you to switch to ALL FOLLOWERS mode. In ALL FOLLOWERS 
           mode,  only commands are shown that can be applied to all active 
           followers.
             
        b) Select Follower
             
           This command appears when the AFT Master Controller is activated in 
           ALL FOLLOWERS mode. For example, if activated with no NPC under the
           target hair. 
             
           Selecting "Select follower" will open a menu that lists all active
           followers. (even followers who are waiting somewhere far away). This
           allows you to remotely issue commands even when you can't reach them
             
        
  B. AFT Settings
        
     In the Miscellaneous category of your inventory, you will find a Holotape
     labeled "AFT Settings". Use this holotape to change global settings or
     perform more admin-like functions like prepping for uninstall.
        
     The holotape can be used on your pipboy or on any other terminal that 
     supports holotapes.

     1) Follower Limit
        
        The Follower limit indicates how many followers you may have in 
        addition to the dog. So for example, at the default value of 3, your
        party size could be 5: The Player, The Dog and 3 additional followers. 
           
           ----------------------
           Global Follower Limit
           ----------------------
           > Limit : 1
           > Limit : 2
           > Limit : 3
           > Limit : 4
           > Limit : 5
           ----------------------
           
        The maximum Follower Limit is 5, which could allow a total party size
        of 7: The player, the dog and 5 additional NPCs.
          
        NOTES: 
          
          This does not affect the maximum number of MANAGED NPCs, which 
          remains hard coded at 32. A Managed NPC is any NPC that you are 
          enhancing with AFT.

           ----------------------
           
        DETAILS:
           
        a) [ ] Minimize Comment Overlap
           
           When you have multiple followers, sometimes they all try to say 
           something at the same time. So AFT includes commentary management to
           try and organized comments so that everyone speaks in turn. 
           
        b) [ ] Limit Comments per Event
           
           This setting is used to cap how many comments are spoken when 
           commentary management is enabled to help commentary feel more
           natural. When toggled, you can limit the number of comments made
           per event from 1 to 4 comments (untoggle for the value 5). The
           Default value is 2.
　
           Notes: 
           
             The Commentary Manager randomly picks the followers that speak 
             comments so that the same companions are not always making all the 
             comments. 
           
           Explanation:
           
             When comments are managed, everyone speaks in turn, but this 
             causes a delay. For example, you step in a river and take 
             radiation damage. 20 seconds later, the river is nowhere in sight 
             but the 5th follower is just now starting to say their peace about
             the radiation. 
           
             In play testing we found that 2 comments felt natural, 3 comments 
             pushed the boundaries and at 4 or more comments the commentary 
             started to feel awkward and unnatural.
                      
     3) Misc Settings
           
        An assortment of unrelated global settings that don't fall into a 
        single category:

           [X] Stealth when Sneaking
           [X] Catch up on Weapon Draw
           [ ] Ignore Murder
           [X] Info Reveals Synths
           [X] Restrict Import
           ----------------------
           
        DETAILS:
           
        a) [X] Stealth when Sneaking
           
           When this box is checked, your followers will receive a stealth boy
           effect anytime you are sneaking to minimize their impact on your 
           visual stealth. 
           
           NOTES:
           
           - If any of your followers are using an AGGRESSIVE combat style (the
             default for several), they will attack enemies on sight and give
             away your stealth. If you are trying to play stealth, make sure 
             to set all Active Followers Combat Style to Defensive. 
           
           - The Stealth boy effect does not work on some races like Mr. Handy.
　
           - Stealth boys don't hide sound. For this reason, large parties 
             (more than dog and 2 NPCS) are almost always detected due to the 
             sound generated when moving.
             
             The recommended stealth approach for larger parties is to tell 
             followers to wait, sneak into an enemy camp solo and then summon
             them to your side once you are clear using the Summon All Action. 
             
        b) [X] Catch up on Weapon Draw
           
           When this box is checked, any Active followers who are not waiting
           and are further than 32 feet away from you will teleport behind you
           anytime you draw your weapon. 
           
           NOTES:
           
             Followers will not teleport behind the player if they are actively 
             in combat. This allows the player to switch weapons during combat 
             without constantly interrupting follower combat. 
           
        c) [ ] Ignore Murder
           
           Toggle this setting if you want companions to ignore Murder events. 
           
           Explanation:
           
             Murder occurs when the player kills someone who was not actively 
             hostile towards the player and was not the target of a current 
             mission/quest. Every one of the 13 original CORE companions hates
             murder and will voice disapproval and threaten to leave if the 
             player is directly responsible for the death of an innocent. 
           
             The most common "accidental" cause of murder is placing powerful 
             mines on the ground near or around settlements.
           
           NOTES:
           
           - This setting only protects the player from MANAGED NPCs. So for 
             example, if you kill a settlement NPC such as Marcy Long, nearby 
             Non-Managed settlers may still react and attack you. 
           
           - When you import an NPC into AFT, they are removed from all 
             factions. So, you can import an NPC (Such as Marcy Long) and then
             eliminate them without reactions or consequences.
             
        d) [X] Info Reveals Synths
           
           By default, AFT will reveal synths in the Traits tab when you Scan 
           NPCs. 
           
           Untoggle this setting to have AFT hide synths and display them as
           regular humans.
　
        e) [X] Restrict Import
           
           By default, AFT will prevent you from forcing core companions to
           follow you to prevent breaking the game. FOr example, if you force
           Piper to be a follower before getting into diamond city you may never
           get into diamond city.
           
           Untoggle this setting if you wish to disable the safeties so you
           can force CORE companions to follow you. Use carefully as bad timing
           can break the game or certain quests/factions (as pointed out above).
           
     4) View Readme
           
        Opens up the In-Game Readme. The In-Game readme is an abbreviated
        Basic version of this readme, with recommendations, special cases and 
        fine-grained details removed.
           
     5) Restore Aft Activator
        
        If you somehow misplace your AFT Activator, you can use this option
        to spawn a new one in your inventory. 
        
     6) Prepare for Uninstall
        
        This option unmanages all of your NPCs, attempting to undo any
        changes AFT made to them. It also shuts down all AFT related 
        support quests and resets variables to pre-install values. 
　
        For example, your spouse will disappear if you rescued them. Your
        AFT Camp will go away. Appearance and wardrobe changes made to 
        companions will be undone to the maximum extent possible. Any 
        followers who were not UNIQUE NPCs will generally disappear. 
　
        Ideally once the method is complete, you would save and then go to 
        the main menu and disable the AFT MOD. The "[M]" will remain next to 
        the save, but the Uninstall ensures AFT gracefully released any 
        resources it was using. (So it shouldn't interfere with any other mods
        you may wish to install and try out).  
　
        Things that are NOT undone:
　
        - Settlement changes and purchases are not be undone. This includes the 
          Clearing of settlements and the purchase of any walls or prefabs. 
　
        - Any visual changes made using the SCULPT menu will persist. So if
          you used the Sculpt menu to change Pipers hair or give Preston a
          difference face, these changes will persist. 
　
        - Death is not undone. So if you used AFT to kill an essential NPC, 
          they will remain dead.
   
  C. AFT Camp
     
     Access AFT's mobile camp from the Actions menu by selecting "Setup Camp".
     
     Players start off with a simple fire pit (cooking Bench) and sleeping bag.
     AFT also adds a Map Marker so players can fast travel back to camp 
     when desired. (Camp can be used as an anchor to return to isolated
     locations). 
     
     The fire pit is persistent. This means if you tear down camp and rebuild
     it elsewhere, your stored items will still be present. 
     
     For many players, a basic portable container/sleeping bag/map marker is
     enough. For those who want more, AFT offers an optional expansion quest 
     that starts the first time you setup camp.   
          
     1) AFT Camp Expansion
　
        The quest involves gathering items and resources to upgrade camp.
　
        a) Find/Fix APC         (to justify mobility)
　
           Requires that you approach the APC marooned in the water near 
           sanctuary or pay someone else to do it for you (500 caps). There 
           is generally a low level creature protecting it (Blood bugs) and 
           Radiation because of nearby barrels. Enter the APC to complete 
           the quest.  
　
        b) Gather/Purchase wood (to build foundation)
　
           Requires either 200 wood or 600 caps. This is generally not 
           difficult if you use the settlement menu to clear/scrap 
           Sanctuary and then grab the wood from the workbench. Once you 
           have the materials, complete quest by going to the TOOLS menu on
           the Aft Activator. 
 
           After this quest is complete, you will get a wooden platform 
           with a terminal when you use the Setup Camp action. The Terminal
           allows you to purchase additional items for camp. 
　
        c) Locate mobile homes (to build Walls)
 
           Requires that you to travel to 4 specific locations that contain 
           mobile home units and enter the mobile home, or pay your followers
           to do it for you. (500 caps each location)
 
           After the Mobile Home quest, the AFT Camp Expansion Quest will 
           complete and disappear from your Tools menu. 
 
        d) Locate and fix UFO
 
           At some point in the game, you will likely witness a UFO crash
           in the distance (it crashes East of Oberton Station). When this 
           occurs, you will see a UFO Camp Expansion Quest show up on 
           the Camp Terminal. You can either hike out to the UFO and salvage
           it yourself or pay someone else to do it for you (10,000 caps)
 
           The UFO upgrade adds a radiation shield to your camp and provides
           an movable platform that can be reach high locations or snipe. 
  
     2) Camp Terminal
    
        To access the Camp Terminal, you must complete the first 2 phases of
        the AFT Camp Expansion Quest. Build camp with a foundation and the 
        terminal will appear:

        > Defenses
        > UFO
        > Settings
        ----------------------
　
        - The Quest menu only appears when Camp Expansion is active. 
        - The UFO menu only appears if you salvage a UFO
　
     3) Camp Terminal : Buildings

           [ ] Module 3
           [ ] Module 4
           ----------------------
           
        Modules will appear as you complete portions of the Camp Expansion 
        quest. By default Modules are enabled, however you can disable
        modules if you prefer a more open camp. 
           
        Each module has a sliding door and light switch that lets you 
        customize the interior lighting of your camp.
　
     4) Camp Terminal : Amenities
        
        Use this menu to purchase amenities or configure options on your
        purchases amenities.

        DETAILS:
             
        a) Benches             
              
           Benches allow you to construct and maintain items. They can also be 
           used to store items you aren't currently using. AFT Camp includes 5 
           possible benches, each one is persistent. (Items remain even when 
           you teardown and reconstruct camp elsewhere).

           In the case of the cooking bench, you can elect to have a fire pit
           in the middle of camp or a stove along one of the walls. 
　
        b) Beds             
　
           Beds allow you to rest and heal. The Med Bay will also allow you to
           heal radiation damage, remove diseases and fix broken limbs. However
           the Med Bay is not available until you have encountered one in the 
           game. Hint: You have to join/visit one of two technologically 
           advanced factions to gain access to one.

           pre-determined.
              
        c) Seating             
              
           Seating provides a place for your followers to sit. Some seats
           such as the Leather Couch will also cause the follower to take
           on a more provocative pose when using it.

           Misc contains a number of interesting items that reflect the
           personality of the player.

              ----------------------
　
           NOTES:
　
           - The CryoPod is a Fridge that can be used to convert Nuka Colas 
             to Ice Cold Nuka Colas or convert them to Cryo Cell ammunition. 
             
           - The Bathroom includes a shower and toilet that followers will
             use. 
　
           - The Memory Lounger is fully function and allows the player 
             to revisit a memory of pre-war sanctuary.
　
　
     5) Camp Terminal : Defenses
           
           Any Defense purchase will places 8 turrets around the parameter of 
           Camp, insuring at least 2 turrets can fire at any approaching enemy 
           target (4 turrets can fire if the target approaches from a corner)
　
           All turrets look the same, though ammunition, fire rate and turret 
           Health differ based on Level. 
　
           ----------------------
           Defenses
           ----------------------
           > Turrets I   : 400 caps
           > Turrets II  : 800 caps
           > Turrets III : 1600 caps
           > Turrets IV  : 3200 caps
           ----------------------
        
        DETAILS:
           
        a) Turrets I
           
           "Turrets I" will appear as a purchase option if the player exceeds 
           level 5. Fires basic 5.56 rounds at a slow rate. 250 HP each. 
           
        b) Turrets II
           
           "Turrets II" will appear after the player exceeds level 15. Fires
           Armor Piercing 5.56 rounds at a higher rate. 500 HP each.
           
        c) Turrets III
           
           "Turrets III" will appear after the player exceeds level 27. Fires
           High energy blue laser blasts at a moderate rate. 750 HP each.
           
        d) Turrets IV
           
           "Turrets IV" will appear after the player exceeds level 39. Fires
           High energy blue laser blasts at very high rate. 1000 HP each.
           
        REPAIRING:
　
          To repair damaged turrets, disable the turrets from the camp console 
          and then re-enable. 
　
     6) Camp Terminal : UFO
          
           ----------------------
           UFO
           ----------------------
           > Set Color
           ^ Raise 500 ^
           V Lower 500 V
           Beam me up!
           Reset Height
           ----------------------
           
           Once salvaged, the UFO will hover above your camp, providing 
           protection from rain and radiation. The bottom of the UFO also
           Provides an additional lighting source. 
           
        DETAILS:
           
        a) Set Color
           
           Similar to the light switches found on other modules, Set Color 
           Allows you to select a color for the bottom of the UFO to create
           unified or themed lighting. A list of colors will appear.
　
        b) Raise 500
           
           By default, the UFO hovers just above camp.  You can raise it    
           Roughly 20 stories into the air from its original location. (The 
           higher camp is to begin with, the higher you can raise it). 
           
           Combined with the Beam Me Up! Ability, this can provide access to
           High areas previously not accessible. For example, collapsed
           Bridges.        
           
        c) Lower 500
           
           This can be used to lower a UFO that was previously raised. It can 
           not be used to lower the UFO below camp. 
           
        d) Beam me up!
           
           Using technology found in the UFO, the player and any active 
           followers are beamed up to the UFO. (As in standing on top of 
           it). To beam back down, open up the Map and fast travel to the AFT 
           Camp Map Marker.  (Or if you have PowerArmor on, just jump...)
           
           NOTE: Radiation protection is lost if UFO is more than 6 stories up. 
　
        e) Reset Height
           
           UFO is returned to its starting position (acting as a roof for camp)
　
     6) Camp Terminal : Setting
　
        For now this area is used to disable/enable Player PowerArmor teleport
        on camp construction. Addition options will eventually be placed here
        as well (Door controls for example).
      
  D. Saving your Spouse
       
     To save your spouse, you need to locate Robot Curie in Vault81 and bring
     her to your spouse's cryopod before the power runs out. Power runs out no 
     later than the start of Chapter 2 and in some cases earlier. For best 
     results, proceed immediately to vault 81 (You can rescue the Minutemen on 
     the way, but I wouldn't do much more than that)
       
     1) Where is Vault 81?
       
        West (and slightly north) of Diamond CIty is a small pond. Vault 81
        Skirts the West side of that pond. Best direct route from Concord 
        is to follow the train tracks south. After you pass Oberland Station, 
        look for a wrecked train on the tracks.  When you get to the train, 
        start heading directly to Diamond City.  You should come across the 
        pond and Vault 81 along the way. 
       
     2) How do I get in?
       
        The easiest and fastest way is to use a charisma challenge and 
        convince the guard you are from another vault. (IE: Save before trying 
        to open the vault and keep reloading until you succeed). Failing that, 
        you have to locate 3 fusion cores to trade to get in, which is almost 
        impossible early in the game.
       
     3) I'm in, now what?
       
        You need to start the Quest "Hole in the Wall". To do this, you have to 
        do two things:
       
        A) Take the tour offered by Austin after you get off the elevator. At 
           the end of the tour, tell Erin you will find her cat Ashes.
　
        B) Go immediately to the Medical facility and talk to Dr. Forsythe.
           Agree to donate some blood. 
       
        C) Leave the Vault Retrieve Ashes the Cat. Don’t talk to anyone. 
           
        D) When you return, Visit medical. You should see Bobby, Dr. Forsythe
           and Dr. Penske talking. Go listen in and accept their request to 
           Explore the hidden vault. 
 
           Common Problems : 
           
           Hole in the wall will start when you enter Vault 81 and all required 
           NPCs are available. IE: not being used by other quests. Hole in the 
           Wall Requires Austin, Dr. Penske, Dr. Forsythe, Bobby De Luca and 
           the Overseer. 
　
           If you talk to any Vault 81 residents and start quests that involve 
           these NPCs, Hole in the Wall gets delayed until those quests are 
           done. So for example, Talking to Tina Delucia can start the quest 
           Dependency, which uses Bobby Delucia. Talking to the School teacher 
           starts a quest that uses Austin. Talking to Dr. Penske can start a 
           quest that involves getting Fertilizer for her.  To start Hole in 
           the Wall as quickly as possible, avoid talking to anyone other than 
           Austin, Erin and Dr. Forsythe.
        
     4) Completing "Hole In the Wall"
    
        It should be noted that if a molerat manages to land a single bite on
        ANYONE, the player will contract the molerat disease. It doesn't matter
        if the NPC is human or robot. It doesn't even matter if they are in 
        your party (if a molerat bytes a patrol robot, you will also get the 
        disease). 
　
        About the only way to complete the quest without getting the molerat 
        disease is to play it solo. If you have a companion with you, tell 
        them to STAY after destroying the 3rd Ceiling Turret. Don't bother 
        using the terminal to activate the patrol robot. 
　
        My Advice: Jump on top of boxes and shoot the molerats from a high 
        location. Keep an eye on your status. If a "Q" suddenly shows up at 
        the bottom of your status window to "view effects", then you got the 
        disease. The mother is the hardest. They may be molerats, but you 
        generally aren't very high level at this point. I actually used the 
        Minigun to take out the mother. 
　
        Once you reach Curie, use Actions -> Summon Everyone to teleport your
        follower(s) back to you. 
　
        Back to the Medical Bay to deal with Austin. After that is done, Curie 
        will ask if she can accompany you. Say yes and then head back to 
        Sanctuary and Vault 111. Approach your spouses Cryo-Pod with Curie (and
        Codsworth if you wish) to begin the rescue scene.
　
     5) Maximizing Spouse Interactions
        
        AFT reuses pre-existing audio to support spouse scenes. When it comes 
        time to play a scene, it checks to see if the required audio is 
        available and if so,  the scene plays. If not, the scene is skipped.
        
        Some audio is only available in specific locations.  So if you wish 
        to ensure all scenes are played, you need to make sure you are in the
        correct area when specific affinity thresholds are reached:
        
        - 250 : This is the hardest scene to witness as the friendship scene
                requires audio that is only  available when standing in Finch
                Farm. If you wish to see the scene, I recommend heading to 
                Finch Farm immediately after rescuing your spouse. Once the 
                location is marked on your map, continue the game as normal, 
                knowing you can fast travel back quickly when your spouse 
                approaches 250.
　
                HINT: If you give your spouse the wedding ring, it will 
                      create a 40 point affinity boost. So wait until your
                      spouse is above 210 and then use the ring to boost
                      the affinity while at Finch's Farm. 
               
        - 500 : The admiration scene will always play, but it will skip some
                lines if you are not near or in Goodneighbor when it plays. 
                Recommendation: When your spouse gets to 425, head to 
                Diamond city and rescue Nick Valentine. That quest takes you to 
                Skinny Malones Base, which is near GoodNeighbor. 
                 
        - 750 : The confidant scene will always play, but it will skip some
                lines if you are not within range of WRVR. Fortunately, the 
                station has a large range covering most of the commonwealth. 
                The lines are rarely skipped unless you are under ground or
                in the far off reaches of the map (like The Glowing Sea).
                
        - 999 : The infatuation scene pulls from globally available lines. 
                This scene should work from anywhere in the game so long as 
                all 13 of the original core companions are still alive. If 
                any of the companions have passed away, some lines may not
                play.
                                 
  E. Creating Your Own Settlement Snapshots
        
     1) Make sure your version of AFT support SnapShots
　
        If you do not see "> Save Prefab" under the Settlement menu, then go  
        and download Amazing Follower Tweaks from:
        
        https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/FalloutNexus.com 
        
        All versions uploaded to that site will include the Save Prefab ability.
        
     2) Enable Debug Logging
        
        a) Open the file :
        
           <My Documents>\My Games\Fallout 4\Fallout4Custom.ini
           
        b) Populate the Fallout4Custom.ini file with the following:
           
           [Papyrus]
           bEnableLogging=1
           bEnableTrace=1
           bLoadDebugInformation=1
           bEnableProfiling=1
           sDefaultLogOverlay=Papyrus
           
     3) Take Snapshot using Settlement Menu
　
        Stand in the Settlement you wish to take a snapshot of, 
        Activate AFT and go to the Tools -> Settlement Menu. 
        
        Select "> Save Prefab" and choose "Batch". 
        
        A file will be created under:
        
        <My Documents>\My Games\Fallout 4\Logs\Script\User\SETTLEMENTNAME.0.log
        
     4) Rename and move output file
　
        Rename file from ".0.log" and replace with ".txt"
        
        Move the file to the Fallout4 Data directory. Typically:
        
        <STEAMDIR>\steamapps\common\Fallout 4\data\SETTLEMENTNAME.txt
     
     5) Use console to load
   
        To load the settlement, make sure you are standing in the settlement
        Open console and type "bat <SETTLEMENTNAME>". For example, if you 
        take a snapshot of RedRocket, you would type "bat RedRocket"
        
        You can use the technique to move Settlements between save games or
        share the settlement with a friend who also has AFT installed. 
　
        NOTE: If you are playing in Survival Mode, the console will not work
              without the aid of a console enabling mod.

V. > > > >  Advanced Trouble Shooting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
　
  1) Everything is Fuzzy
　
     When you raise the PipBoy, the world becomes fuzzy. If somehow you lower
     the pipboy and the game doesn't realize it, it can leave the world fuzzy. 
     Easiest fix is to look at your PipBoy again. When it lowers, it should
     solve the problem.
　
     Failing that, try getting into PowerArmor.
　
  2) PipBoy doesn't work
　
     This can happen if a MOD executes UNEQUIPALL on the player, leaving them
     without a pipboy. Unfortunately, this is hard to fix without the aid of
     a console. So if you do not have access to a console, your only option 
     is to reload a save where you still had a working Pipboy.
　
     If you have console, you can restore the Pipboy with the following 
     command:
　
        player.equipitem <TODO: Look up Pipboy code>
　
  3) A follower keeps walking away
　
     - Start by dismissing them and asking them to follow you again.
     - If that doesn't work, try UNMANAGING them and then re-import them. 
       (Or ask them to follow you if they are a CORE companion)
     - If that doesn't work, it could be a MOD conflict. Make sure AFT is at
       the bottom of your load order. 
     - If AFT is at the bottom of your load order, make sure there are no 
       .pex files in your Fallout 4/Data/Scripts directory. Some mods don't 
       properly use BSA archives. When a PEX file is in your Fallout 4
       directory, it can override any mods you have installed regardless of
       mod priority.
　
  4) AFT Activator acts like NPC is not under target hair when activated.
　
     As long as AFT Activator is working on SOMEONE, then it is safe to 
     say this behavior is by design. For example, if you are in Combat and 
     you try to to use AFT on a companion, it will act like they are not 
     there.  There are also cases of NPCs that are marked as non-manageabe by 
     AFT because they are essential to the plot.
　
  5) AFT does not initialize.
　
     The most common reason for this is a mod conflict over the Followers
     QUEST resource. If you are using aft with a previously modded save
     game and you had a different follower mod, it is possible that the
     required resources are still reserved by the other mod. 
　
     Best way to rule this out is place AFT at the bottom of your load
     order and start a new game. You should see AFT initialize within 
     20 seconds of exiting Vault 111 (after the prologue). 
　
  6) Game Crashes (When Loading a Prefab or some time aftwards)
　
     This happens when a mod such as AFT disables and/or deletes an 
     object within a settlement that a SETTLER is assigned to use. For
     example, if a settler is told to sleep in a specific bed and 
     AFT removes the bed. When the settler attempts to sleep
     (around 9 PM game time), the game may crash.
　
     The key here is how the settler gets assigned. If the game 
     assigns the settler automatically, then the game seems to be fine. It
     only crashes when users manually assign a settler to a job/bed using 
     the workshop menu and then the object is removed by a script.
　
     Crashing occurs when the settler attempts to use the deleted
     item. This may not happen immediately. For example, settlers
     don't attempt to sleep during the day. Furthermore, settlers
     remain dormant (doing nothing) when you are not actively near 
     the settlement. So days could pass with no crash and then one day
     you are near the buggy settler at the wrong time and boom.
　
     So if a crash occurs at what appears to be some random moment 
     when you are near a settlement, chances are a settler is just now 
     attempting to use an item you cleared when you ran "Clear Settlement" 
     or "Load Prefab".  
　
     How to fix: 
　
     a) One way is to go around and scrap all the assignable items 
        (beds, food, defense platforms, etc..). 
　
     b) An alternative to A (for evil characters) is to go around kill 
        everyone. Not an option at all settlements, but certainly for some. 
　
     c) A more fine grained approach is to use a settlement bell to summon
        everyone and then go around and see if you can figure out who is 
        still assigned to something. Typically when you hover over a settler
        it will say Assigned or Unassigned. If you are having crashing issues, 
        you know it is one of the assigned settlers. Try assigning them 
        to something else or killing them off.
　
    d) Remember, it is only an issue if you MANAULLY assign a task to 
       someone. Clear and Load Prefab are generally safe on newly 
       aquired Settlements, even ones that already have settlers.

VI. > > > >  Uninstall
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Open up your inventory and go to the MISC category. You should find a 
  Holotape labeled "AFT Settings". Use the holotape to bring up AFT Settings on
  your Pipboy. The Following menu should appear:
           
        ----------------------
        Global AFT Settings
        ----------------------
        > Follower Limit : 3
        > Chat Settings
        > Misc Settings
        > View Readme
        > Restore Aft Activator
        > Prepare for Uninstall
        ----------------------
　
  Select the Final Entry "Prepare for Uninstall".
　
  A progress bar will appear. Once complete a message box will pop up with 
  instructions. They will tell you to exit the current game, Go to the MODS 
  menu and then disable "AmazingFollowerTweaks". Shut the game down and 
  restart once the mod is disabled (or deleted).
         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VII. > > > >  Technical (For developers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
  A. AFT Mandatory Resources (And potential areas of conflict)
           
     AFT avoids using original game resources, but there are cases where AFT
     had to because of tight integration with the original game.
           
     1) Quests: 
           
        a) Followers
           
           One of the few and only resources AFT must have to function. If it 
           is unable to obtain this quest because of another higher-priority 
           mod, AFT will not work.
           
           Not only does it make changes to the Follower Script (encapsulated 
           by a new state), but it also injects new aliases which are linked to
           by other quests. 
           
     2) Scripts
           
         a) followerscript.pex
            
            Attached to the Followers Quest, it redirects game core 
            functionality to use AFT. If this script is being overridden by
            a local file, AFT will not work.
　
  B. AFT Optionally Required Resources (And potential areas of conflict). 
           
     1) Quests
　
        a) DialogueCodesworthPostWar
           
           AFT makes some changes to this quests scene conditions so that it 
           uses the SPEAKER instead of the PLAYER. This allows codsworth to 
           speak gender appropriate comments to your spouse if the spouse is 
           rescued. If AFT doesn't get this resource, Codsworth may refer to 
           the SPOUSE using the wrong gender. (Not game breaking)
           
        b) DogmeatQuest
           
          AFT changes dogmeats alias flags so that Dogmeats name isn't 
          reserved and can be changed. Without AFT, dogmeats name is "Dog" 
          unless you learn his name from Mama Murphey in Concord. AFT changes
          it so that Dogmeats name is Dogmeat from the beginning but can be
          changed using AFTs naming system. If AFT doesn't get this quest, 
          you can't rename Dogmeat.
        
     2) Locations
        
        a) Commonwealth Location Wilderness, Coordinates (95,80)
        
          AFT places ObjectReference instances in this cell for items that 
          can not be created or changed using scripts. Most notably, this is
          where AFT stores the AFT CAMP Map marker. It also stores various
          objectreferences that use scripts like the CIS_EnterNewLocation 
          Script to hint to the CK that the mod needs the CIS_EnterNewLocation
          pex file.   
          
     3) Scripts 
        
          In some cases, AFT simply includes .pex files to override original 
          Game scripts. This works as long as changes do not introduce new 
          Properties or parameters (and no other mod provides the same script). 
          In the case of contention, the mod with the higher priority (bottom 
          of the mod list) wins.
              
          a)  CIS_EnterNewLocationTrigger.pex
              
              Provides support for Commentary Management
              
          b)  TrapBarnacle.pex
                   
              Provides support for trap avoidance
                   
          c)  TrapBase.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
              
          d)  TrapBreakableWalkway.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
              
          e)  TrapCanChimes.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
              
          f)  TrapExplGas.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
              
          g)  TrapThistleScript.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
              
          h)  TrapTrigTension.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
              
          i)  traptripwire.pex
              
              Provides support for trap avoidance
         
         
  C. AFT as a Soft Dependency
　
     Developers wishing to make stand-alone mods will often create soft 
     Dependencies on other mods (or DLC). That is: They will check for them, 
     but they wont rely on them, simply disabling certain features if another 
     mod isn’t present. 
　
     Soft dependencies are implemented using intermod communication methods. 
     For example, to retrieve to get the global variable TweakFollowerCount, 
     from AFT, you could do the following:
　
       String aftstr = "AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp" const
       GlobalVariable g
       g = Game.GetFormFromFile(0x01000FA2, aftstr) As GlobalVariable
　
     However, you don't want to retrieve the value all the time, because if a
     user does not have AFT, the call above will result in an error message
     getting logged to the log file. (Thus lots of calls could equal lots of 
     log spam and a performance hit). Even when logging is disabled, the method 
     above is expensive.
　
     1) Creating a Proxy
　
     The best way to implement a SOFT dependency on AFT is to create a proxy
     quest that checks for resources once and caches everything you need for 
     later access. Below is an example that exposes the number of followers and 
     the clearsettlement function:
　
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Quest  : AFTProxy
     Script : AFTProxyScript
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Scriptname AFTProxyScript extends Quest Conditional
　
     String aftstr = "AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp" const
　
     Bool Property Installed Auto Conditional
　
     ; List of properties you would like to expose...
     GlobalVariable Property TFCount Auto ; Shorthand for TweakFollowerCount
     Quest Property TweakScrapper Auto    ; Shorthand for TweakScrapScanMaster
     
     ; Support
     int NO_LOAD_FLOOD = 200 const
     int NO_LOAD_RETRY = 300 const
　
     Event OnQuestInit()
       Actor player = Game.GetPlayer()
       RegisterForRemoteEvent(player,"OnPlayerLoadGame")
       StartTimer(0.0, NO_LOAD_FLOOD)
     EndEvent
　
     Event Actor.OnPlayerLoadGame(Actor akSender)
       Actor player = Game.GetPlayer()
       UnRegisterForRemoteEvent(player,"OnPlayerLoadGame")
       RegisterForRemoteEvent(player,"OnPlayerLoadGame")
       StartTimer(0.5, NO_LOAD_FLOOD)
     EndEvent
　
     int attempts
     Event OnTimer(int timerID)
       CancelTimer(timerID)
       if (NO_LOAD_FLOOD == timerID)
         attempts = 0
         LoadAFTProxy()
         return             
       endif
       if (NO_LOAD_RETRY == timerID && attempts < 3)
         attempts += 1
         LoadAFTProxy()             
         return
       endif
     EndEvent
　
     Function LoadAFTProxy()
       if Game.IsPluginInstalled(aftstr)
         
         ; Sometimes there are timing issues. Retry up to 3 times
         
         Bool issue = false
         ; Load Resources
         TweakScrapper = Game.GetFormFromFile(<TODO>, aftstr) As Quest
         TFCount = Game.GetFormFromFile(0x01000FA2, aftstr) As GlobalVariable
         
         if (!TweakFollowerCount || !TFCount)
           StartTimer(4.0, NO_LOAD_RETRY)
           Installed = false
         else
           Installed = true
         endif
       else
         Installed = false
       endif
     EndFunction
　
     Function AFTClearSettlement()
        if !Installed
          return
        endif
        ScriptObject s = TweakScrapper.CastAs("AFT:TweakScrapScanMasterScript")
        if s
           s.CallFunctionNoWait("clearSettlement", new Var[0])
        endif
     EndFunction
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
             
             
        The key with the proxy above is that it does all the work once when 
        someone starts a new game or loads a save. You can then use the proxy 
        within your source code and even conditions within CK Elements (Using
        GetVMQuestVar). 
　
          <TODO: Show Usage Example of Above Proxy>
　
              
     2) Resources
             
        Example Resources you can add/access/control in the proxy above: 
        This is not comprehensive. Just the most significant entry points:
             
        a) Quests
                          
           TweakPipBoy              0x01000FA2
             
             Hosts AFT:TweakPipBoyScript, which deals will relaying commands
             issued from the PipBoy to the proper areas of the mod. In some 
             simple cases (toggling a globalvariable for example), the PipBoy
             script functions handle the actions locally.
             
             This quest + script + function can be used to acces most the 
             functionality in AFT as the Pipboy is the primary interface.
             The only reason to side-step the PipBoy is if you wanted to avoid
             PipBoy use. (Many functions will re-raise the Pipboy up).
             
           TweakFollower            0x01000FA2
             
             Hosts reference aliases that store state information for all the 
             NPCs managed by AFT. (Pose, outfit, etc..). Also hosts 
             TweakFollowerScript, which is the destination of most PipBoy
             commands (GUI aspect removed).

VIII. > > > >  Making an AFT addon mod that expands settlement Prefab options
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          
  The settlement prefab system was intentionally designed to be easily expanded
  using Add-On Mods.
          
  An Addon mod is a mod that requires AFT to be installed, but extends AFT so 
  that your settlement appears when users browse PreFabs available at a 
  specific location. This way, you don’t have to convince the developer of AFT 
  to include your settlement, you just make your own settlement and put it out 
  there.
　
  You can even create Prefabs for DLC or MOD based Settlements (as long as the
  mod properly registers the Settlement with the WorkshopParent). 
　
  A. How do Addons Work Anyway? (For Developers)
          
     Papyrus allows you to attach a "pointer" to something using a specific 
     name. For example, the game tracks the players PowerArmor by using the
     pointer name "LinkedArmor". 
          
        Player === (LinkedArmor) ===> [PowerArmor]
          
     These pointers are called LinkedRefs. You can't use just any old string
     name. You have to register the string name as a keyword. So to get the 
     players PowerArmor you would use:
          
       Keyword LinkedArmor = Game.GetForm(...) as Keyword
       ObjectReference PowerArmor = Game.GetPlayer().GetLinkedRef(LinkedArmor)
          
     In this case, the pointer goes from the player to the PowerArmor. It can 
     also go the other way. In fact, a large number of objects can point to the
     player using the same LinkedRef Keyword name:
          
       [PowerArmorA] === (LinkedArmor) ===> [Player]
       [PowerArmorB] === (LinkedArmor) ===> [Player]
       [PowerArmorC] === (LinkedArmor) ===> [Player]
          
     If we want to get all the PowerArmors that point at the player,we can use:
          
       ObjectReference[] PAs = Game.GetPlayer().GetRefsLinkedToMe(LinkedArmor)
          
     And this is the Basis for Addons. AFT looks for any Objects Pointing at a 
     Workbench that use AFT’s prefab keyword "TweakPrefab":
       
       [AronsAwesomePrefab] === (TweakPrefab) ===> [RedRocket Workbench]
       [PattiesPinkPrefab]  === (TweakPrefab) ===> [RedRocket Workbench]
       [NormsNominalPrefab] === (TweakPrefab) ===> [RedRocket Workbench]
     
     AFT then exposes the objects via AFT’s PipBoy... assuming the objects 
     properly cast to AFT’s TweakPrefabOption interface.
　
     These objects can be installed/instantiated by anyone. Which means a mod 
     can be installed after AFT that adds a new object/prefab to the game 
     world that AFT will recognize.
          
  B. Prefab Components:
          
     To build a Prefab Mod Extension, you need to create 3 things in the CK:
          
     - A Furniture with TweakPrefabOption and TweakBuilder scripts attached
         
     - A Quest with the script TweakRegisterPrefab attached as well as a
       Script with the output from "Save prefab -> Payprus" attached.
                    
     - A Terminal based on the AFT Template "TweakPrefabTerminalTemplate" that 
       identifies the Name and Author of the Prefab.
          
  C. Step By Step
          
     For this example, replace <AuthorName> with your handle. IE: the name you 
     go by on NexusMods or Bethesda.Net. Replace <PrefabName> with the name of 
     Settlement Prefab. Every Prefab needs a unique name + Author so people
     know what they are choosing (and to avoid conflicts). 
           
     So before you begin, decide on a name for your Prefab and which handle you
     will use. 
           
     1) If you haven't already downloaded it, get Creation Kit. Here is a
        starter link I wrote for beginners:
          
        https://www.creationkit.com/fallout4/index.php?title=Hello_World
          
     2) Load Fallout 4 and AmazingFollowerTweaks resources:
          
        - Start Creation Kit
        - File => Data... => Check Fallout 4.esm and AmazingFollowerTweaks.esp
        - Hit [OK]
          
     3) Set Compile options for release-final
          
        - File => Preferences
        - Scroll Right and select the "Scripts" Tab
        - Select "Release Final" as compile option
        - Hit [Apply]
          
     4) Create a Terminal
          
        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Scroll down to the
          WorldObjects -> Terminal section and hi-light it. 
          
        - Enter "TweakPrefabTerminalTemplate" in the Filter box at the top of 
          the Left Pane.
 
        - Find the Terminal in the Right Pane and Double click on it to open.
        - Change the ID of the Terminal : 
          
            ID: <AuthorName><PrefabName>Terminal
          
        - Hit [OK] and select yes when prompted if you want to make a new Form. 
          (Don't do anything else yet)
          
     5) Update Terminal
          
        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Put your <AuthorName> in 
          the filter at the top of the pane. Dbl Click your new Terminal in the
          right pane: ( <AuthorName><PrefabName>Terminal )
          
        - Click on the Item Text entry. Change <PREFAB> - <AUTHOR> To reflect
          your prefab name and author info.
          
        - Change the $$$ in the entries to reflect the cost. 
          
          - I normally add all the component counts from my save output and 
            Round to the nearest multiple of 25. That becomes my cost.  But 
            you can do whatever you want. Whatever you use, you may want to
            write it down as you will need the numbers again soon.
          
        - Hit OK to save the changes and then Re-Open the Terminal.
          
        - Highlight LoadFull (...) and in the script window, Hit Properties
          Type : Quest
          Name : pTweakPipBoy
          
          When you hit Okay, it should auto-fill
          
          Hit [OK] Again to Return to the Terminal Details screen.
          
        - Select "Load Full ($$$)" option
          In the papyrus fragment, paste the following (without the
          hyphen lines:
　
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
AFT:TweakPipBoyScript PipBoyScript = pTweakPipBoy as AFT:TweakPipBoyScript
if PipBoyScript
    PipBoyScript.BuildFullPrefab()
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
          
        - Select "The Load Wall Only ($$$)" option
          In the papyrus fragment, paste the following (without the
          hyphen lines:
          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
AFT:TweakPipBoyScript PipBoyScript = pTweakPipBoy as AFT:TweakPipBoyScript
if PipBoyScript
    PipBoyScript.BuildWallOnlyPrefab()
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
          
        - Select "Next" option
          In the papyrus fragment, paste the following:
          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
AFT:TweakPipBoyScript PipBoyScript = pTweakPipBoy as AFT:TweakPipBoyScript
if PipBoyScript
    PipBoyScript.NextPrefab()
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
          
        - Select "Previous" option
          In the papyrus fragment, paste the following:
          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
AFT:TweakPipBoyScript PipBoyScript = pTweakPipBoy as AFT:TweakPipBoyScript
if PipBoyScript
    PipBoyScript.PrevPrefab()
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------          
　
        - Hit [OK]. It may take a while as it has to compile the scripts          
　
     6) Create Furniture (Stub)
　
        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Scroll down to 
          WorldObjects -> Furniture and hi-light Furniture.
　
        - In the Filter Box at the top of the left pane, enter 
          "InvisibleGeneric01"
　
        - Open up the Furniture and Rename it to reflect your Mod
          
          ID: <AuthorName><PrefabName>Furn
　
        - Hit [OK], (Twice to confirm you want to make a new ID).
　
　
     7) Create a Quest
　
        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Scroll down to 
          Character -> Quest and hi-light Quest
　
        - Within the right pane of the Object Window, Right-Click the 
          Background and select "New"
　
        - ID : <AuthorName>PrefabsQuest
          - Notice we didn't put the Prefab Name in the Quest. That is because 
            you can use 1 quest to manage all your prefabs.
          - Leave "Start Game Enabled" and "Run Once" checked. 
　
        - Hit [OK] 
　
　
     8) Update Quest
　
        - Double Click the Quest you just created. (You may have to filter for 
          your <AuthorName>) Opening it up a second time should reveal the 
          Scripts Tab.
　
        - Click on the "Scripts" Tab, then Click [Add]
　
        - Look for the existing Script "TweakRegisterPrefabScript"
　
        - The Properties Window should appear. Double Click the "Prefabs" 
          Property and then Click Add. You will see two entries appear: 
　
            PrefabFurniture : Fill with <AuthorName><PrefabName>Furn
            PrefabLocation  : Fill with the Location of the Settlement

              ** If it is a DLC or Mod settlement, you can figure it out by 
                 looking at the papyrus output. The first parameter to 
                 tbs.init() is the ID of the location of the settlement. Use 
                 Windows Calculator to convert this to Hex and then search for 
                 The hex value in the CK Filter box to get the name of the 
                 location.
　
        - Click OK (twice) until you are back at the scripts tab. 
　
          NOTES: You can use this single script to Register multiple Prefabs by
                 adding additional furnitures to the Prefabs list.
　
        - From the "Scripts" Tab, Click [Add] => "[New Script]"
　
        - Name your script: <AuthorName><PrefabName>Script. Make sure to 
          Check the [X] Const option. 
　
        - Open up the script. This is where you paste the papyrus output 
          That was saved to the LogFile during Save Prefab:
　
          ** The Creation Kit default editor can’t handle large scripts. 
             It will OPEN them and COMPILE them, but wont allow you to 
             Edit them after they exceed a certain size. A paste into the
             CK editor will likely fail and get truncated. 
　
             Most users will have to open and edit their script using The 
             "Open with External Editor" option in order to paste in the 
             large BuildFull() method(s).

          If you saved off a Wall-Only export, you will need to rename the 
          "BuildFull" function to "BuildWallOnly" and also change the
          default for "clearFirst" and "requireNoFood" to be 0 and paste
          the edited function below the BuildFull() version. IE:

ScriptName Example Extends Quest Const
　
Function BuildFull(TweakBuilderScript tbs, int clearFirst = 1, int 
requireNoFood = 1)
    ; requires [401] of [731A4] (471460)
    ; requires [653] of [731A3] (471459)

        - Finally, you need to compile the script. Do this by opening the 
          script with the CK’s default editor. Go to the File menu of the 
          Editor and Select compile.
　
    9) Update Furniture
　
        - Within the left pane of the Object Window, Scroll down to 
          WorldObjects -> Furniture and hi-light Furniture.
　
        - In the Filter Window, enter "<AuthorName>"
　
        - Open up Your Furniture (<AuthorName><PrefabName>Furn)
　
        - In the Scripts Area, Click Add.
   
          Attach the script TweakBuilderScript
　
        - In the Scripts Area, Click Add (again).
　
          Attach the script TweakPrefabOption
　
        - Dbl Click TweakPrefabOption to Open up its properties
　
        - Fill out the Properties:
　
          - PrefabTerminal   : Point at <AuthorName><PrefabName>Terminal
          - PrefabQuest      : Point at <AuthorName>PrefabsQuest
          - PrefabLoadScript : Enter "<AuthorName><PrefabName>Script" 
                               (without the dbl quotes)
　
            ** If you have namespace prefixes enabled, don't forget to 
               prepend them to the script name: 
　
               "<Prefix>:<AuthorName><PrefabName>Script"
　
               When in doubt, re-open the <AuthorName><PrefabName>Script under 
               the quest tab and note the name at the top. This is what should 
               go here.
　
          - PrefabPriceFull  : Price of Full Prefab (From Terminal)
          - PrefabPriceWall  : Price of Wall-Only Prefab (From Terminal)
　
          - Only Enable PrefabHasWallOption if you manually added a 
            BuildWallOnly() Function to the LoadScript.
　
          - By Default, Walls will not clear a settlement but Full Prefabs
            will. You can override this, though it is not recommended.
　
        - Once you finish filling out the Setup and Options Properties, 
          hit [Auto-Fill All] to fill in the Auto_Fill_All properties.
　
        - Hit [OK] to save Properties. And then [OK] on the Furniture.
　
  D. Save and Name Your Mod
　
     You were likely asked for an "Active" File when you began modding. 
     THe active file is where changes you make are stored. 
　
     Go to the Data Menu and highlight your active file. Fill in the 
     author and mod description info on the right.
　
  E. Package
　
     Within Creation Kit select Data -> Create Archive, Hit Pack
　
     IMPORTANT : Name the BSA : "<YOURMODNAME> - Main.ba2". If the archive 
     doesn't end with "- Main", it will be ignored.
　
  F. Test
　
     To Properly test, Move any local PEX files found under
　
         <FALLOUT4>/Data/Scripts
　
     to a backup location outside the Fallout 4 directory. (Desktop temp 
     folder?). Then test and ensure your settlement appears and builds.
　
  G. Live Long and Prosper..... and Share...
　
     You didn't go to all this trouble to hoard your settlement all to 
     yourself.  Upload the Mod to NexusMods or even Bethesda.Net. You can 
     even upload it as a Console mod. (Though I am not sure how that works with 
     Mod Dependencies). Don't forget to take some pictures and upload them to 
     AFTS Mod Page at https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/ with a blurb 
     identifying the author/addon mod. Nothing gets users interested in 
     downloading addons like Pictures.
